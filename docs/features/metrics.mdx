Conduit comes with a number of already defined metrics. The metrics available
are exposed through an HTTP API and ready to be scraped by Prometheus. It's also
possible to easily define new metrics with existing types, or just create a
completely new metric type.

## Accessing metrics

Metrics are exposed at `/metrics`. For example, if you're running Conduit
locally, you can fetch metrics by navigating to 
[`http://localhost:8080/metrics`](http://localhost:8080/metrics).

## Available metrics

* **Conduit metrics**: We currently have a number of high level pipeline,
  processor and connector metrics, all of which are defined
  in [measure.go](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/blob/main/pkg/foundation/metrics/measure/measure.go)
  . Those are:

  | Pipeline name                                  | Type      | Description                                                                                                    |
  |------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `conduit_pipelines`                            | Gauge     | Number of pipelines by status.                                                                                 |
  | `conduit_connectors`                           | Gauge     | Number of connectors by type (source, destination).                                                            |
  | `conduit_processors`                           | Gauge     | Number of processors by name and type.                                                                         |
  | `conduit_connector_bytes`                      | Histogram | Number of bytes a connector processed by pipeline name, plugin and type (source, destination).                 |
  | `conduit_pipeline_execution_duration_seconds`  | Histogram | Amount of time records spent in a pipeline.                                                                    |
  | `conduit_connector_execution_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Amount of time spent reading or writing records per pipeline, plugin and connector type (source, destination). |
  | `conduit_processor_execution_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Amount of time spent on processing records per pipeline and processor.                                         |

* **Go runtime metrics**: The default metrics exposed by Prometheus' official Go
  package [client_golang](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/client_golang).
* **gRPC metrics**: The gRPC instrumentation package we use
  is [promgrpc](https://github.com/piotrkowalczuk/promgrpc). The metrics exposed
  are listed [here](https://github.com/piotrkowalczuk/promgrpc#metrics).
* **HTTP API metrics**: We
  use [promhttp](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp),
  Prometheus' official package for instrumentation of HTTP servers.
