An OpenCDC record in Conduit aims to standardize the format of data records
exchanged between different connectors within a data processing pipeline. The
primary objective is to ensure compatibility between various combinations of
source and destination connectors.

## Benefits

1. **Support for Operations**: The format should support representing records
   for `create`, `update`, `delete`, and `snapshot` operations.
2. **Standard Metadata Fields**: Definition of standard metadata fields to
   provide essential information about each record. These can vary depending on
   the record. See [Metadata Fields](#metadata-fields) for more information.
3. **Integration with Data Tools**: We believe that being strict about the
   record format Conduit consumes and produces will make it easier to integrate
   with other data processing tools.

## Fields

* `.Position` uniquely represents the position of record. This is used to track
  the position of a record in a source connector, enabling Conduit to resume a
  stopped pipeline.
* `.Operation` defines what triggered the creation of a record. There are four
  possibilities: `create`, `update`, `delete` or `snapshot`. The first three
  operations are encountered during normal CDC operation, while `snapshot` is
  meant to represent records during an initial load. Depending on the operation,
  the record will contain either the payload before the change, after the
  change, both or none (see fields `.Payload.Before` and `.Payload.After`).
* `.Key` represents a value that should identify the entity (e.g. database row).
* `.Metadata` contains additional information regarding the record.
* `.Payload.Before` holds the payload before the operation ocurred. These could
  be present in operations such as `update` and `delete`.
* `.Payload.After` holds the payload after the operation ocurred. These could be
  present in operations such as `create`, `snapshot` or `update`.

:::note
We're indicating `.Position`, and not `.position` as defined in
its [`Record` message](https://buf.build/conduitio/conduit-commons/docs/main:opencdc.v1#opencdc.v1.Record),
to show its [Go template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) notation as used by
the [Go representation of an OpenCDC record](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-commons/blob/main/opencdc/record.go#L32).
This field is public and must start with an uppercase letter.

## Representation

Conduit uses [Protocol Buffers (protobuf)](https://protobuf.dev/) to define an
OpenCDC record. Its definition can be found in
the [Buf Schema Registry](https://buf.build/conduitio/conduit-commons/docs/main:opencdc.v1).

When processing records in Conduit, you can always expect a similar structure to
the following:

```json
{
    "position": "c3RhbmRpbmc=",
    "operation": "update",
    "metadata": {
        "file.path": "./example.in",
        "opencdc.readAt": "1663858188836816000",
        "opencdc.version": "v1"
    },
    "key": "cGFkbG9jay1rZXk=",
    "payload": {
        "before": "eWVsbG93",
        "after": {
            "bool": true,
            "float32": 1.2,
            "float64": 1.2,
            "int": 1,
            "int32": 1,
            "int64": 1,
            "string": "orange"
        }
    }
}
```

:::note
`.Position`, `.Key`, and `.Payload.Before` are represented as `Base64` encoded
in the example above because these will be a byte slice when represented as
JSON.

## Data types


There are no limitations when it comes to data types a source connector can read
from a source. Certain type limitations might apply depending on how the data is
moved internally in Conduit, from source connector to Conduit and from Conduit
to destination connectors.

The key and the payload data can be represented in two ways: raw and structured.

## Raw data

Raw data in Conduit is an array of bytes that can represent the source data in
its original form (such as a file) or encoded in a certain way (for example, a
JSON representation of a database row or an Avro encoded structure). It's
represented by the `opencdc.RawData` Go type. For example, when writing a
connector or a processor in Go, you can construct raw data like this:

```go
opencdc.RawData([]byte{1, 3, 5})
```

## Structured data

Structured data in Conduit is a map in which the keys are field names and values
are field values. An example of that is the below record's `.Payload.After`
field: 


```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "payload": {
        "before": "eWVsbG93",
        "after": {
            "bool_field": true,
            "float_field": 1.2,
            "int_field": 1,
            "string_field": "orange"
        }
    }
}
```

When writing a connector or a processor in Go, it's represented by
the `opencdc.StructuredData` type. 

The supported data types for values in `opencdc.StructuredData` depend on following:
- connector or processor type (built-in or standalone)
- [schema support](/docs/features/schema-support) (enabled or disabled).

In built-in connectors, the field values can be of any Go type, given that
there's no (de)serialization involved.

In standalone connectors with schema middleware enabled (which is the default),
any type that is supported by the [Apache Avroâ„¢ format](https://avro.apache.org)
is also supported by Conduit.

If the schema middleware is disabled in a connector, then the supported types
are limited to what Protobuf allows as
a [value](https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#value). That
translates to the following Go types:

* `bool`
* `int`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint`, `uint32`, `uint64`
* `float32`, `float64`
* `string`
* `[]byte` (stored as a string, base64-encoded)
* `map[string]interface{}` (a map of strings to any of the values that are supported)
* `[]interface{}` (a slice of any value that is supported)

A notable limitation is timestamps, i.e. `time.Time` values are not supported.

## Metadata fields

As part of an OpenCDC record, there will be a set of fields provided that will
vary depending on the connector. These fields can be common to all **OpenCDC**
records as part of our standard, some related to **Conduit**, and others that
will be provided by each **Connector** implementation independently. These
fields can be useful to define conventions that will be then used by Conduit to
expand its functionality. Notice that all these fields use a dot notation syntax
to indicate what they refer to, preventing accidental clashes. Here are the ones
you can find:

### `opencdc.version`

Contains the version of the OpenCDC format (e.g., "v1"). This field exists to
ensure the OpenCDC format version can be easily identified in case the record
gets marshaled into a different untyped format (e.g. JSON).

```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "metadata": {
        "opencdc.version": "v1",
        // rest of metadata
    },
    // other record fields
}
```

### `opencdc.createdAt`

Contains the time when the record was created in the 3rd party system. The
expected format is a Unix timestamp in nanoseconds.

```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "metadata": {
        "opencdc.createdAt": "1663858188836816000",
        // rest of metadata
    },
    // other record fields
}
```

### `opencdc.readAt`

Contains the time when the record was read from the 3rd party system. The
expected format is a Unix timestamp in nanoseconds.

```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "metadata": {
        "opencdc.readAt": "1663858188836816000",
        // rest of metadata
    },
    // other record fields
}
```

### `opencdc.collection`

Contains the name of the collection from which the record originated and/or
where it should be written to.

:::note
It's up to the connector to populate this field. In other words, not all records
may have this field.
:::

```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "metadata": {
        "opencdc.collection": "employees",
        // rest of metadata
    },
    // other record fields
}
```

### `opencdc.key.schema.*`

#### `opencdc.key.schema.subject`, `opencdc.key.schema.version`

Contains the subject and version of the schema for the records' `.Key` field.

:::note
This field will only be populated when using structured data.
:::

```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "metadata": {
        "opencdc.key.schema.subject": "employees.key.v1",
        "opencdc.key.schema.version": "1",
        // rest of metadata
    },
    // other record fields
}
```

### `opencdc.payload.schema.*`

#### `opencdc.payload.schema.subject`, `opencdc.payload.schema.version`

Contains the subject and version of the schema for the records' `.Payload` field.

:::note
This field will only be populated when using structured data.
:::

```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "metadata": {
        "opencdc.payload.schema.subject": "connector-id:collection.payload",
        "opencdc.payload.schema.version": "1",
        // rest of metadata
    },
    // other record fields
}
```

### `conduit.source.plugin.name`

The name of the source plugin that created the record.


```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "metadata": {
        "conduit.source.plugin.name": "builtin:file",
        // rest of metadata
    },
    // other record fields
}
```

### `conduit.source.plugin.version`

The version of the source plugin that created the record.


```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "metadata": {
        "conduit.source.plugin.version": "v1.0.2",
        // rest of metadata
    },
    // other record fields
}
```

### `conduit.source.connector.id`

`conduit.source.connector.id` is the ID of the source connector that received the record.

```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "metadata": {
        "conduit.source.connector.id": "connectorID",
        // rest of metadata
    },
    // other record fields
}
```
### `conduit.destination.plugin.name`

The name of the destination plugin that has written the record.

```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "metadata": {
        "conduit.destination.plugin.name": "builtin:file",
        // rest of metadata
    },
    // other record fields
}
```


### `conduit.destination.plugin.version`

The version of the destination plugin that has written the record.

```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "metadata": {
        "conduit.destination.plugin.version": "v0.9.1",
        // rest of metadata
    },
    // other record fields
}
```

### `conduit.dlq.nack.error` 
Contains the error that caused a record to be nacked and pushed to the [dead-letter queue (DLQ)](/docs/features/dead-letter-queue).

### `conduit.dlq.nack.node.id` 
The ID of the internal node that nacked the record. 

### Connector-specific metadata

These metadata fields will be provided by each connector implementation allowing
them to add any necessary metadata. As previously mentioned, to avoid unintended
conflicts of metadata keys, the convention these will follow are the same as
before, indicating first the connector name that's adding them.

Taking the same [previous record example](#representation), you'll notice there
is a metadata key named `file.path`, which would indicate this field was added
by a `file` plugin.

```json5
{
    // other record fields
    "metadata": {
        "file.path": "./example.in",
        // rest of metadata
    },
    // other record fields
}
```
