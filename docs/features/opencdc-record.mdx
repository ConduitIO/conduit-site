An OpenCDC record in Conduit aims to standardize the format of data records exchanged between different connectors within a data processing pipeline. The primary objective is to ensure compatibility between various combinations of source and destination connectors.

## Benefits

1. **Support for Operations**: The format should support representing records for `create`, `update`, `delete`, and `snapshot` operations.
2. **Standard Metadata Fields**: Definition of standard metadata fields to provide essential information about each record. These can vary depending on the record. See [Metadata Fields](#metadata-fields) for more information.
3. **Integration with Data Tools**: We believe that being strict about the record format Conduit consumes and produces will make it easier to integrate with other data processing tools.

## Fields

* `.Position` uniquely represents the position of record. This is used to track the position of a record in a source connector, enabling Conduit to resume a stopped pipeline.
* `.Operation` defines what triggered the creation of a record. There are four possibilities: `create`, `update`, `delete` or `snapshot`. The first three operations are encountered during normal CDC operation, while `snapshot` is meant to represent records during an initial load. Depending on the operation, the record will contain either the payload before the change, after the change, both or none (see fields `.Payload.Before` and `.Payload.After`). 
* `.Key` represents a value that should identify the entity (e.g. database row).
* `.Metadata` contains additional information regarding the record.
* `.Payload.Before` holds the payload before the operation ocurred. These could be present in operations such as `update` and `delete`.
* `.Payload.After` holds the payload after the operation ocurred. These could be present in operations such as `create`, `snapshot` or `update`.

:::note
We're indicating `.Position`, and not `.position` as defined in its [`Record` message](https://buf.build/conduitio/conduit-commons/docs/main:opencdc.v1#opencdc.v1.Record), to show its [Go template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) notation as used by the [Go representation of an OpenCDC record](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-commons/blob/main/opencdc/record.go#L32). This field is public and must start with an uppercase letter.

## Representation

Conduit relies on [Protocol Buffers (protobuf)](https://protobuf.dev/) when it comes to defining an OpenCDC record to benefit from the several advantages that it provides. Its definition can be found in the [Buf Schema Registry](https://buf.build/conduitio/conduit-commons/docs/main:opencdc.v1).

When processing records in Conduit, you can always expect a similar structure to the following:

```json
{
    "position": "c3RhbmRpbmc=",
    "operation": "update",
    "metadata": {
        "file.path": "./example.in",
        "opencdc.readAt": "1663858188836816000",
        "opencdc.version": "v1"
    },
    "key": "cGFkbG9jay1rZXk=",
    "payload": {
        "before": "eWVsbG93",
        "after": {
            "bool": true,
            "float32": 1.2,
            "float64": 1.2,
            "int": 1,
            "int32": 1,
            "int64": 1,
            "string": "orange"
        }
    }
}
```

:::note
`.Position`, `.Key`, and `.Payload.Before` are represented as `Base64` encoded in the example above because these will be a byte slice when represented as JSON.

## Metadata fields

As part of an OpenCDC record, there will be a set of fields provided that will vary depending on the connector. These fields can be common to all **OpenCDC** records as part of our standard, some related to **Conduit**, and others that will be provided by each **Connector** implementation independently. These fields can be useful to define conventions that will be then used by Conduit to expand its functionality. Notice that all these fields use a dot notation syntax to indicate what they refer to, preventing accidental clashes. Here are the ones you can find:

### OpenCDC

- `opencdc.createdAt` can contain the time when the record was created in the 3rd party system. The expected format is a Unix timestamp in nanoseconds.
- `opencdc.readAt` can contain the time when the record was read from the 3rd party system. The expected format is a Unix timestamp in nanoseconds.
- `opencdc.version` contains the version of the OpenCDC format (e.g., "v1"). This field exists to ensure the OpenCDC format version can be easily identified in case the record gets marshaled into a different untyped format (e.g. JSON).

```json
{
    ...
    "metadata": {
        "opencdc.createdAt": "1663858188836816000",
        "opencdc.readAt": "1663858188836816000",
        "opencdc.version": "v1",
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

### Conduit

Only available in records once they are read by a **source plugin**:

- `conduit.source.plugin.name` is the name of the source plugin that created the record.
- `conduit.source.plugin.version` is the version of the source plugin that created the record.
- `conduit.source.connector.id` is the ID of the source connector that received the record.

```json
{
    ...
    "metadata": {
        "conduit.source.connector.id": "connectorID",
        "conduit.source.plugin.name": "example",
        "conduit.source.plugin.version": "v1",
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

Only available in records once they are written by a **destination plugin**:

- `conduit.destination.plugin.name` is the name of the destination plugin that has written the record.
- `conduit.destination.plugin.version` is the version of the destination plugin that has written the record.

```json
{
    ...
    "metadata": {
        "conduit.destination.plugin.name": "example",
        "conduit.destination.plugin.version": "v1",
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

When a record is sent to the [Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)](/dead-letter-queue), you'll also see these extra fields that will give you an insight into why the landed in the DQL.

- `conduit.dlq.nack.error` contains the error that caused a record to be nacked and pushed to the dead-letter queue.
- `conduit.dlq.nack.node.id` is the ID of the internal node that nacked the record. 

### Connector

These metadata fields will be provided by each connector implementation allowing them to add any necessary metadata. As previously mentioned, to avoid unintended conflicts of metadata keys, the convention these will follow are the same as before, indicating first the connector name that's adding them.

Taking the same [previous record example](#representation), you'll notice there is a metadata key named `file.path`, which would indicate this is record processed by a `file` plugin.

```json
{
    ...
    "metadata": {
        "file.path": "./example.in",
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```
