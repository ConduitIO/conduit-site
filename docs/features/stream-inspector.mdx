Conduit's stream inspector makes it possible to peek at the data as it enters Conduit via source connectors and what the
data looks like as it travels to destination connectors. Keep in mind that this feature is about sampling data as it
passes through the pipeline not tailing the pipeline.

Stream inspection doesn't affect a pipeline's performance. However, if the data is being pushed through the stream very
fast, it's possible that you may not see all of the records. This is done to protect Conduit's performance (by not keeping
too much data in the memory) and to protect the pipeline's performance (by not blocking it until data is inspected).

The inspection will **not** be automatically stopped if the connector being inspected is stopped. This makes it
possible to "catch" all the records, from the moment a connector starts. It also makes it possible to inspect records
as you're potentially restarting a pipeline.

Stream inspection is available via the Conduit UI and API:

## UI

To access the stream inspector through the UI, first navigate to the pipeline which you'd like to inspect. Then, click
on the connector in which you're interested. You'll see something similar to this:

![stream inspector pipeline view](/img/stream-inspector-pipeline.png)

Click the "Inspect Stream" button to start inspecting the connector. A new pop-up window will show the records:

![stream inspector show stream](/img/stream-inspector-show-stream.png)

On the "Stream" tab you'll see the latest 10 records. If you switch to the "Single record" view, only the last record
will be shown. You can use the "Pause" button to pause the inspector and stop receiving the latest record(s). The ones
that are already shown will be kept so you can inspect them more thoroughly.

## API

To access the stream inspector through the API, you'll need a WebSocket client (for example [wscat](https://github.com/websockets/wscat)).
The URL on which the inspector is available comes in the following format: `ws://host:port/v1/connectors/<connector ID>/inspect`.
For example, if you run Conduit locally with the default settings, you can inspect a connector by running the following
command:

```shell
$ wscat -c ws://localhost:8080/v1/connectors/pipeline1:destination1/inspect | jq .
{
  "result": {
    "position": "NGVmNTFhMzUtMzUwMi00M2VjLWE2YjEtMzdkMDllZjRlY2U1",
    "operation": "OPERATION_CREATE",
    "metadata": {
      "opencdc.readAt": "1669886131666337227"
    },
    "key": {
      "rawData": "NzQwYjUyYzQtOTNhOS00MTkzLTkzMmQtN2Q0OWI3NWY5YzQ3"
    },
    "payload": {
      "before": {
        "rawData": ""
      },
      "after": {
        "structuredData": {
          "company": "string 1d4398e3-21cf-41e0-9134-3fe012e6d1fb",
          "id": 1534737621,
          "name": "string fbc664fa-fdf2-4c5a-b656-d52cbddab671",
          "trial": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The above command also uses `jq` to pretty-print the output. You can also use `jq` to decode Base64-encoded strings,
which may represent record positions, keys or payloads:

```shell
wscat -c ws://localhost:8080/v1/connectors/pipeline1:destination1/inspect | jq '.result.key.rawData |= @base64d'
```
