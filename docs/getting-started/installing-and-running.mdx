## Running Conduit using a pre-built binary

The recommended way of running Conduit on a local machine is using a pre-built binary. Below we'll walk through getting Conduit installed and running on your system.

### Download

First, download the [latest Conduit release](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/latest) for your platform.

For an ARM based back Mac for example we'd grab the `conduit_0.10.0_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz` archive.

### unzip the archive

```shell
tar xzvf conduit_0.10.0_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz
```

### Run

In the directory in which you expanded the archive. Execute the Conduit binary:

```shell
./conduit
```

```shell
             ....
         .::::::::::.
       .:::::‘‘‘‘:::::.
      .::::        ::::.

      `::::        ::::‘
       `:::::....:::::‘
         `::::::::::‘        Conduit v0.10.0 linux/amd64

2024-02-20T21:37:45+00:00 INF
```

You should now be able to interact with the Conduit UI and HTTP API on port 8080.

## Building from source

Before you can build Conduit from source, you need to have Go 1.21 or higher installed. The Go website has [comprehensive instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install) on how to get the language installed on your machine. Once installed, you can follow the rest of the instructions.

1. Start by downloading the source code from the latest stable release on the Conduit [Releases Page](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/latest). Alternatively, you can run this command to automatically download the latest stable source to your current directory:

```shell
$ TAG=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/latest | grep "tag_name\": \"v[0-9.]*" | awk -F \" '/tag_name\": \"*\"/{print $(NF-1)}') && curl -o conduit.tgz -L https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/tarball/$TAG
```

A file called `conduit.tgz` will be in your current directory. The next step is to expand the source:

```shell
$ tar zxvf conduit.tgz
```

Then change directories to the appropriate folder. Keep in mind that the folder name might be different between releases since it's tied to the latest git sha for the commit.

```shell
$ cd ConduitIO-
```

Now build the project:

```shell
$ make
```

If you want to build conduit without the UI, instead of running `make`, you can run the following command:

```shell
$ make build-server
```

You will have a new binary built for your architecture and machine. All that's left is to run it!

```shell
./conduit
```

## Installing Conduit with Homebrew

On MacOS we provide the option of installing Conduit via Homebrew

```
brew install conduit
```

## Running Conduit with Docker

We distribute [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) images to ease the use of Conduit in a containerized environment. To see details about how our images are built please feel free to take a look at the `Dockerfile` [here](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/blob/main/Dockerfile).
Conduit's Docker images are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/pkgs/container/conduit).

After you install Docker, you can pull the Conduit image by running the following command:

```shell
docker pull conduit.docker.scarf.sh/conduitio/conduit
```
Then, you can run Conduit by running:

```shell
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 conduit.docker.scarf.sh/conduitio/conduit
```

The command aboves runs Conduit with no pipelines. To run Conduit with a custom pipeline file you can mount it as a volume into the container:
```shell
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/pipeline.yaml:/app/pipelines/pipeline.yaml \
  conduit.docker.scarf.sh/conduitio/conduit
```

**Helpful Tip:** If you're using Docker, check out [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/). After we push an update, Watchtower will keep your Conduit container updated by gracefully shutting down your existing container and restarting it with the same options used when initially deployed.

## Next Steps

Now that you have Conduit installed it's time to explore some other topics.
