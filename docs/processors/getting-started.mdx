A processor is a component that operates on a single record that flows through a pipeline. It can either **transform** the record, or **filter** it out based on some criteria. Since they are part of pipelines, making 
yourself familiar with [pipeline semantics](/docs/features/pipeline-semantics) is highly recommended.

Processors are **optional** components in a pipeline (i.e. a pipeline can be started without them), and they are always
attached to a single parent, which can be either a connector or a pipeline:

- **Connector processors**:
  - **Source processors** only receive messages originating at a specific source connector. Source
   processors are created by specifying the corresponding source connector as the parent entity.
   - **Destination processors** only receive messages that are meant to be sent to a specific
   destination connector. Destination processors are created by specifying the corresponding destination connector as
   the parent entity.
- **Pipeline processors** receive all messages that flow through the pipeline, regardless of the
   source or destination. Pipeline processors are created by specifying the pipeline as the parent entity.


## Processor types

When it comes to using a processor, Conduit supports different types:

- [Built-in processors](/docs/processors/builtin) will perform the most common operations you could expect such as filtering fields, replacing fields, posting payloads to a HTTP endpoint, etc. These are already coming as part of Conduit, and you can simply start using them with a bit of configuration. [Check out this document to see everything that's available](/docs/processors/builtin).
- [Standalone processors](/docs/processors/standalone-processors) are the ones you could write yourself to do anything that's not already covered by the [Built-in](/docs/processors/builtin) ones. [Here's](/docs/processors/standalone-processors) more information about them.

## How to use a processor

In these following examples, we're using the [`json.decode`](/docs/processors/builtin/json.decode), but you could use any other you'd like from our [Built-in](/docs/processors/builtin/) ones, or even [reference](/docs/processors/referencing) your own [Standalone processor](/docs/processors/standalone-processors).

When referencing the name of a processor plugin there are different ways you can make sure you're using the one you'd like. Please, check out the [Referencing Processors](/docs/processors/referencing) documentation for more information.

### Using a [pipeline configuration file](/docs/pipeline-configuration-files/getting-started)

#### Using a pipeline processor

Creating a pipeline processor through a pipeline configuration file can be done as below:

```yaml
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: example-pipeline
    connectors:
    # define source and destination connectors
    # ...
    processors:
      - id: extract-name
        plugin: json.decode
        settings:
          field: name
```

#### Using a connector processor

Similarly, we can configure a connector processor, i.e. a processor attached to a connector:

```yaml
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: example-pipeline
    connectors:
      - id: conn1
        # other connector configuration
        processors:
          - id: extract-name
            plugin: json.decode
            settings:
              field: name
      # other connectors
```

The documentation about pipeline configuration files can be found [here](/docs/configuration/pipeline-configuration-files).

### Using the [HTTP API](/api)

The processor endpoints live under the `/v1/processors` namespace, and to attach a processor to either connector or a pipeline, you could do a `POST` request to `/v1/processors` specifying `parent.type` as `TYPE_PIPELINE` or `TYPE_CONNECTOR`. Default value is `TYPE_UNSPECIFIED`. 

[Here's](/api#post-/v1/processors) how the entire request could look like.
