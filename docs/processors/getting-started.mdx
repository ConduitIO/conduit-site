A processor is a component that operates on a single record that flows through a pipeline. It can either **transform** the record, or **filter** it out based on some criteria. Since they are part of pipelines, making 
yourself familiar with [pipeline semantics](/docs/features/pipeline-semantics) is highly recommended.

Processors are **optional** components in a pipeline (i.e. a pipeline can be started without them), and they are always
attached to a single parent, which can be either a connector or a pipeline:

- **Connector processors**:
  - **Source processors** only receive messages originating at a specific source connector. Source
   processors are created by specifying the corresponding source connector as the parent entity.
   - **Destination processors** only receive messages that are meant to be sent to a specific
   destination connector. Destination processors are created by specifying the corresponding destination connector as
   the parent entity.
- **Pipeline processors** receive all messages that flow through the pipeline, regardless of the
   source or destination. Pipeline processors are created by specifying the pipeline as the parent entity.

Given that every processor can have one (and only one) parent, processors cannot be shared. In case the same processing
needs to happen for different sources or destinations, you have two options:

1. If records from all sources (or all destinations) need to be processed in the same way, then you can create
   a **pipeline processor**.
2. If records from some, but not all, sources (or destinations) need to be processed in the same way, then you need to
   create multiple processors (one for each source or destination) and configure them in the same way.

## Supported processors

Whenit comes to using a processor either on a connector, or a pipeline, Conduit supports different types:

- [Built-in processors](/docs/processors/builtin) will perform the most common operations you could expect such as filtering fields, replacing fields, posting payloads to a HTTP endpoint, etc. These are already coming as part of Conduit, and you can simply start using them with a bit of configuration. [Check out this document to see everything that's available](/docs/processors/builtin).
- [Custom processors](/docs/processors/standalone-processors) are the ones you could write yourself to do anything that's not already covered by the [Built-in](/docs/processors/builtin) ones. [Here's](/docs/processors/standalone-processors) more information about them. Using our [Wasm processor](/docs/processors/) you can even write your processor in your own coding language of choice.

## Creating a processor through a pipeline configuration file

Creating a pipeline processor through a pipeline configuration file can be done as below:

```yaml
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: example-pipeline
    connectors:
    # define source and destination connectors
    # ...
    processors:
      - id: extract-name
        type: extractfieldpayload
        settings:
          field: name
```

Similarly, we can configure a connector processor, i.e. a processor attached to a connector:

```yaml
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: example-pipeline
    connectors:
      - id: conn1
        # other connector configuration
        processors:
          - id: extract-name
            type: extractfieldpayload
            settings:
              field: name
      # other connectors
```

The documentation about pipeline configuration files can be found [here](/docs/configuration/pipeline-configuration-files).

## Creating a processor through the HTTP API

Processors are created through the `/processors` endpoint. Here's an example:

```json lines
POST /v1/processors
{
  // type of the processor in Conduit
  "type": "extractfieldpayload",
  "parent": {
    // type of parent: TYPE_CONNECTOR or TYPE_PIPELINE
    "type": "TYPE_CONNECTOR",
    // parent ID (connector ID in this case)
    "id": "aed07589-44d8-4c68-968c-1f6c5197f13b"
  },
  "config": {
    "settings": {
      // configuration map for this processor
      "field": "name"
    }
  }
}
```

The request to create a processor is described
in [api.swagger.json](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/blob/main/pkg/web/openapi/swagger-ui/api/v1/api.swagger.json).
