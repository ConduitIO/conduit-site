Conduit allows you to process records in concurrently using the `workers`
parameter. This can be particularly beneficial for processors performing
time-consuming computations on a fast stream of records.

:::tip Ordering guarantee

When processors are configured to process records concurrently, they guarantee
that the order of records won't change. Although records may be processed out of
order, the resulting order of records coming out of the processor is guaranteed
to be unchanged.

:::

Consider a pipeline that needs to process 100 records per second. One of the
processors in the pipeline needs to retrieve data from a server, and this
operation typically takes 1 second to complete. Since this operation is executed
for every record, sequential processing won't keep up with the stream. However,
by configuring the processor to use 100 workers, we can execute the slow
operation concurrently on 100 records at a time. This enables us to process 100
records per second.

Note that in reality we would want to configure an even higher number of workers
to provide some room for handling larger bursts.

## Configuration

You can configure a processor to run concurrently by specifying the number of
workers. By default, the number of workers is set to 1, which means that records
are processed sequentially.

Here is an example pipeline configuration that configures the `js` processor to
run in parallel using 10 workers:

```yaml
version: 2.0
pipelines:
  - id: example-pipeline
    connectors:
      # define source and destination connectors
      # ...
    processors:
      - id: example-js
        type: js
        workers: 10 # configure 10 workers that run concurrently
        settings:
          script: >
            function process(record) {
              record.Metadata["foo-key"] = "foo-value";
              return record;
            }
```
