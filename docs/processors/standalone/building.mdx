You can build your own Conduit standalone processors in Go using the [Processor SDK](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-processor-sdk).

We currently only provide a Go SDK for processors. However, if you'd like to use another language for writing a processor,
feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature%2Ctriage&projects=&template=1-feature-request.yml&title=Processor+SDK+%3A+%3Clanguage%3E)
and request a specific language SDK. You can also read [how standalone processors work](/docs/processors/standalone/how-it-works)
under the hood and build an SDK yourself.

The [Processor SDK](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-processor-sdk) exposes two ways of building processors, one for
simple processors without configuration parameters, and another that gives you full control over the processor.

## Using `sdk.NewProcesorFunc`

If the processor is very simple and can be reduced to a single function (e.g.
no configuration needed), then we can use `sdk.NewProcessorFunc()` to create a processor as below:

```go
//go:build wasm

package main

import (
   sdk "github.com/conduitio/conduit-processor-sdk"
)

func main() {
   sdk.Run(&sdk.NewProcessorFunc(
      sdk.Specification{Name: "simple-processor"}),
      func(ctx context.Context, rec opencdc.Record) (opencdc.Record, error) {
         // do something with the record
         return rec
      },
   )
}
```

However, if the processor needs configuration, or is more complicated than only one function, then we should use
the full processor approach.

## Using `sdk.Processor`

To build the full-blown processor, the SDK contains an interface called [sdk.Processor](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-processor-sdk#Processor)
that contains some methods to be implemented. These methods are:

### Specification

Specification contains the metadata for the processor, which can be used to define how to reference the processor,
describe what the processor does and the configuration parameters it expects. Here's a list of the fields in the
`sdk.Specification` struct and their descriptions:

  * `Name`: the name of the processor. Note that the name should be unique across all processors, as it's used to
    reference the processor in a pipeline (see [referencing processors](/docs/processors/referencing)).
  * `Version`: the version of the processor. This should be a valid [semver](https://semver.org) version and needs to be
    updated whenever the processor's behavior changes.
  * `Summary`: a short description of what the processor does (ideally a one-liner).
  * `Description`: a more detailed description of what the processor does. This field can contain markdown.
  * `Author`: the author of the processor.
  * `Parameters`: a map of the processor's configuration parameters. Each parameter should have a name, a type, a
    description, and a list of validations. Note that the validations defined on a parameter are automatically executed
    in `sdk.ParseConfig` (see [Configure](#configure)).

Conduit also provides [`paramgen`](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-commons/tree/main/paramgen), a helpful tool that
generates the `Parameters` map from a Go struct. This allows us to create a configuration struct that contains the
processor's parameters, define default values and validations using struct tags, and generate the `Parameters` map.
Check out the [ParamGen readme](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-commons/tree/main/paramgen) for more details.

:::info

Note that a processor's name and version need to be unique across all processors, as they are used to
[reference](/docs/processors/referencing) the processor in a pipeline. If two processors have the same name and version,
Conduit will refuse to load them.

:::

#### Example without ParamGen

You can define the `Specification` method as below and manually define the parameters map:

```go
package example

import (
	"context"

	"github.com/conduitio/conduit-commons/config"
	sdk "github.com/conduitio/conduit-processor-sdk"
)

func (p *AddFieldProcessor) Specification(context.Context) (sdk.Specification, error) {
	return sdk.Specification{
		Name:    "myAddFieldProcessor",
		Summary: "Add a field to the record.",
		Description: `This processor lets you configure a field that will
be added to the record into field. If the payload is not
structured data, this processor will panic.`,
		Version: "v1.0.0",
		Author:  "John Doe",
		Parameters: map[string]config.Parameter{
			"field": {
				Type: config.ParameterTypeString,
				Description: "Field is the target field that will be set.",
				Validations: []config.Validation{
					config.ValidationRequired{},
				},
			},
			"name":  {
				Type: config.ParameterTypeString,
				Description: "Name is the value of the field to add.",
				Validations: []config.Validation{
					config.ValidationRequired{},
				},
			},
		},
	}, nil
}
```

#### Example with ParamGen

1. Add a struct that contains the needed parameters:

```go
//go:generate paramgen -output=addField_paramgen.go addFieldConfig

type addFieldConfig struct {
	// Field is the target field that will be set.
	Field string `json:"field" validate:"required"`
	// Name is the value of the field to add.
	Name string `json:"value" validate:"required"`
}
```

2. Generate the parameters by running:

````
paramgen -output=addField_paramgen.go addFieldConfig
````

This will generate a file
called `addField_paramgen.go` that contains the generated parameters map, which in turn can be used under `specification`
to make it simpler and shorter, example:

```go
//go:generate paramgen -output=addField_paramgen.go addFieldConfig

type addFieldConfig struct {
	// Field is the target field that will be set.
	Field string `json:"field" validate:"required"`
	// Name is the value of the field to add.
	Name string `json:"value" validate:"required"`
}

func (p *AddFieldProcessor) Specification(context.Context) (sdk.Specification, error) {
	return sdk.Specification{
		Name:    "myAddFieldProcessor",
		Summary: "Add a field to the record.",
		Description: `This processor lets you configure a  field that will
be added to the record into field. If the payload is not
structured data, this processor will panic.`,
		Version: "v1.0.0",
		Author:  "John Doe",
		Parameters: addFieldConfig{}.Parameters(), // generated by paramgen
	}, nil
}
```

### Configure

Configure is the first function to be called in a processor. It provides the processor with the configuration that needs
to be validated and stored to be used in other methods.
This method should not open connections or any other resources. It should solely focus on parsing and validating the 
configuration itself.

To add custom validations, simply validate the parameters manually under this method, and return an error if the `config`
map is not valid. On the other hand, using the utility function below would apply the builtin validations to the configuration.

The [Processor SDK](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-processor-sdk) provides some useful utility functions to help implementing this method:
* `sdk.ParseConfig`: used to sanitize the configuration, apply defaults, validate it using builtin validations, and copy
the values into the target object. 
* `sdk.NewReferenceResolver`: creates a new reference resolver from the input string. The input string is a reference
to a field in a record, check [Referencing record fields](/docs/processors/referencing-fields) for more details.
The method will return a `resolver` that can be used to resolve a reference to the specified field in a record and
manipulate that field (`get`, `set` and `delete` the value, or `rename` the referenced field).

Using these utility functions, most of the `Configure` method implementations would look something like:
````go
func (p *AddFieldProcessor) Configure(ctx context.Context, m map[string]string) error {
	err := sdk.ParseConfig(ctx, m, &p.config, addFieldConfig{}.Parameters())
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to parse configuration: %w", err)
	}

	resolver, err := sdk.NewReferenceResolver(p.config.Field)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to parse the %q param: %w", "field", err)
	}
	p.referenceResolver = resolver
	return nil
}
````

### Open

This function is used to open connections, start background jobs, or initialize resources that are needed for the processor.

Note that implementing this function is **_optional_**.

### Process

Process is the main show of the processor, here we would manipulate the records received and return the processed ones.

After processing the slice of records that the function got, and if no errors occurred, it should return a slice of 
`sdk.ProcessedRecord` that matches the length of the input slice. However, if an error occurred while processing a 
specific record, then it should be reflected in the `ProcessedRecord` with the same index as the input record, and
should return the slice at that index length.

For the interface `sdk.ProcessedRecord`, there are three main processed records types:
1. `sdk.SingleRecord`: is a single processed record that will continue down the pipeline.
2. `sdk.FilterRecord`: is a record that will be acked and filtered out of the pipeline.
3. `sdk.ErrorRecord`: is a record that failed to be processed and will be nacked.

Example:

````go
func (p *AddFieldProcessor) Process(ctx context.Context, records []opencdc.Record) []sdk.ProcessedRecord {
	out := make([]sdk.ProcessedRecord, 0, len(records))
	for _, record := range records {
		resolver, err := p.referenceResolver.Resolve(&record)
		if err != nil {
			return append(out, sdk.ErrorRecord{Error: err})
		}
		err = resolver.Set(p.config.Name)
		if err != nil {
			return append(out, sdk.ErrorRecord{Error: err})
		}
		out = append(out, sdk.SingleRecord(record))
	}
	return out
}

````

Note that `Process` should be idempotent, as it may be called multiple times with the same records (e.g. after a restart
when records were not flushed).

### Teardown

This function acts like a counterpart to [`Open`](#open), use this function to close any open connections or resources
that were initialized under `Open`.

Note that implementing this function is also **_optional_**.

### Entrypoint

Since the processor will be run as a standalone _WASM_ plugin, we need to add an entrypoint to it. Also, we
should add a `go:build` tag to ensure that this file is only included in the build when targeting WebAssembly.

the entrypoint will have to be in a separate package (i.e. folder), by Go convention it's normally under 
`cmd/my-binary-name`, so it would look something like:

```
.
├── my-processor.go    # actual processor implementation
└── cmd
    └── processor
        └── main.go    # entrypoint
```

Entry point example:

```go
//go:build wasm

package main

import (
	sdk "github.com/conduitio/conduit-processor-sdk"
	"github.com/conduitio/my-processor/example"
)

func main() {
	sdk.Run(example.NewProcessor())
}
```

## Schemas

Processors have access to the schemas in the used Schema Registry. By default, if the pipeline uses a schema
registry and the processor gets a record with the schema info in the `Metadata`, then the processor will have
a middleware enabled. The middleware will decode the records before they are passed to the processor
using their corresponding schema from the schema registry, and encode them again after the processing is done. To
change this default behaviour, you can change these processor's configurations accordingly:
- `sdk.schema.decode.key.enabled`: Whether to decode the record key using its corresponding schema from the schema registry.
- `sdk.schema.decode.payload.enabled`: Whether to decode the record payload using its corresponding schema from the schema registry.
- `sdk.schema.encode.key.enabled`: Whether to encode the record key using its corresponding schema from the schema registry.
- `sdk.schema.encode.payload.enabled`: Whether to encode the record payload using its corresponding schema from the schema registry.

**Example** of a piepline configuration file with these parameters:
```yaml
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: test
    status: running
    connectors:
      - id: employees-source
        type: source
        plugin: standalone:generator
        settings:
          rate: 1
          collections.str.format.type: structured
          collections.str.format.options.id: int
          collections.str.format.options.name: string
          collections.str.format.options.admin: bool
          collections.str.operations: create
      - id: logger-dest
        type: destination
        plugin: standalone:log
    processors:
      - id: access-schema
        plugin: standalone:processor-simple
        sdk.schema.decode.key.enabled: false # disabling the default behaviour
        sdk.schema.encode.key.enabled: false # disabling the default behaviour
```

Processors can access the Schema Registry and the schemas using two utility functions:
1. `schema.Create` : You can use this utility function to create a new schema and add it to the Schema Registry.
This function can be called in any of the main processor methods.
    
**Example**:
```go
func (p *exampleProcessor) Open(ctx context.Context) error {
	// Add a new schema to the schema registry before starting to process the records.
	schemaBytes := []byte(`{
          "name": "record",
          "type": "record",
          "fields": [
            {
              "name": "admin",
              "type": "boolean"
            },
            {
              "name": "id",
              "type": "int"
            },
            {
              "name": "name",
              "type": "string"
            }
          ]
        }`)
	_, err := schema.Create(ctx, schema.TypeAvro, "subject1", schemaBytes)
	return err
}
```

2. `schema.Get`: You can use this utility function to get a schema from the Schema Registry using
  its `version` and `subject`. This function can be called in any of the main processor methods.

  **Example**:
```go
func (p *exampleProcessor) Process(ctx context.Context, records []opencdc.Record) []sdk.ProcessedRecord {
out := make([]sdk.ProcessedRecord, 0, len(records))
for _, record := range records {
		// get the schema subject name from the metadata
		subject, err := rec.Metadata.GetPayloadSchemaSubject()
		if err != nil {
			return append(out, sdk.ErrorRecord{Error: err})
		}
		// get the schema version from the metadata
		version, err := rec.Metadata.GetPayloadSchemaVersion()
		if err != nil {
			return append(out, sdk.ErrorRecord{Error: err})
		}
		// get the schema using the subject and the version
		get, err := schema.Get(ctx, subject, version)
		// print the schema
		fmt.Println(string(get.Bytes))
        // rest of the code...
        // ...
```
   Example output (the printed schema):
```json
{
  "name": "record",
  "type": "record",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "admin",
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    {
      "name": "id",
      "type": "int"
    },
    {
      "name": "name",
      "type": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Logging

You can get a `zerolog.logger` instance from the context using the [`sdk.Logger`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-processor-sdk#Logger)
function. This logger is pre-configured to append logs in the format expected by Conduit.

Keep in mind that logging in the hot path (i.e. in the `Process` method) can have a significant impact on the performance
of the processor, therefore we recommend using the `Trace` level for logs that are not essential for the operation of the
processor.

Example:

```go
func (p *AddFieldProcessor) Process(ctx context.Context, records []opencdc.Record) []sdk.ProcessedRecord {
	logger := sdk.Logger(ctx)
	logger.Trace().Msg("Processing records")
	// ...
}
```

## Compiling the processor

Conduit uses [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) to run standalone processors. This means that we need to build
the processor as a WebAssembly module. You can do this by setting the environment variables `GOARCH=wasm` and `GOOS=wasip1`
when running `go build`. This will produce a WebAssembly module that can be used as a processor in Conduit.

So, to compile the processor, run:
```sh
GOARCH=wasm GOOS=wasip1 go build -o processor.wasm cmd/processor/main.go
```

**_Congratulations!_** Now you have a new standalone processor.
Check [Standalone processors](/docs/processors/standalone/index) for details on how to use your standalone
processor in a Conduit pipeline.
