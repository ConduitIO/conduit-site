# Standalone processors

These are processors you'd write yourself in cases the [Built-in](/docs/processors/builtin/) ones don't meet your needs. 

## How to write one

Thanks to our [Web Assembly (Wasm) processor](/docs/processors/standalone/how-it-works) you can start writing processors in any language that can be compiled to Web Assembly. As a start, Conduit already provides a [conduit-processor-sdk](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-processor-sdk) that will let you [write a processor](/docs/processors/standalone/building) in Golang.

### Where to put them

By default, standalone processors are expected to be found in a folder named `processors` alongside of your pipelines or [standalone connectors](/docs/connectors/getting-started):

```shell
│ # Conduit binary
├── conduit
│ # Folder with pipeline configurations
├── pipelines
│ # Folder with standalone connectors (binary files)
├── connectors
│ # Folder with standalone processors (wasm files)
└── processors
```

However, in case you need to reference processors in a different location, you could use the `-processors.path` flag when running Conduit:

```
./conduit -processors.path /my-custom-processors-path
```

### Using the [conduit-processor-sdk](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-processor-sdk)

Assuming you use our [conduit-processor-sdk](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-processor-sdk), this is how a processor **plugin** written in Golang could look like. In the following example, we're going to be adding a `processed` field to each record processed by our pipeline:

```go
//go:build wasm

package main

import (
    "context"

    "github.com/conduitio/conduit-commons/opencdc"
    sdk "github.com/conduitio/conduit-processor-sdk"
)

func main() {
    sdk.Run(sdk.NewProcessorFunc(
        sdk.Specification{Name: "simple-processor", Version: "v1.0.0"},
        func(ctx context.Context, record opencdc.Record) (opencdc.Record, error) {
            record.Payload.After.(opencdc.StructuredData)["processed"] = true
            return record, nil
        },
    ))
```

After that, you'd need to compile it, and locate its `.wasm` file into the desired `processors` directory as previously mentioned:


```shell
GOARCH=wasm GOOS=wasip1 go build -o simple-processor.wasm main.go
```

## Using it in your pipeline


As mentioned in our [Getting Started page](/docs/processors/getting-started), in order to use a processor in your pipeline, you need to update its [configuration file](/docs/processors/getting-started#how-to-use-a-processor) and [reference it](/docs/processors/referencing) accordingly:


```yaml
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: example-pipeline
    connectors:
    # define source and destination connectors
    # ...
    processors:
      - id: add-processed-field
        plugin: standalone:simple-processor
```

When running your pipeline again, you should expect seeing a new `processed` field on every record processed.
