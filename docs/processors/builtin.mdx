:::note
Note that all built-in processors that operate on the payload actually operate on `Record.Payload.After`.
If you need to manipulate the field `Record.Payload.Before` you can use
a [JavaScript processor](./javascript-processors).
:::

Below is a list of available built-in processors in Conduit. An example usage of a built-in processor is available in
[`extract-field-transform.sh`](https:github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/blob/main/examples/processors/extract-field-transform.sh).
The script will run Conduit with a pipeline containing the built-in `extractfieldpayload` processor.

### extractfieldkey

- If the key is raw and has a schema attached, extracts the field and uses it to replace the entire key.
- If the key is raw and has no schema, returns an error (not supported).
- If the key is structured, extracts the field and uses it to replace the entire key.

### extractfieldpayload

Works in the same way as [extractfieldkey](#extractfieldkey), except that its applied to `Record.Payload.After`.

### filterfieldkey

`filterfieldkey` includes or excludes records using an XPath expression.

#### Configuration

- `type`: sets the behavior to "include" or "exclude" the record based on the result of the condition.
- `condition`: is an XPath query expression that the user defines to forward or drop a record on its results.
- `missingornull`: defines how to handle the record in the event the fields the query would use don't exist.
- `exists`: gives the user a chance to define an existence query for a given filter.

If `condition` passes, then it will immediately handle the record as `type` dictates. If `condition` doesn't match
and `exists` matches nothing, then it will handle the record as `missingornull` specifies.

Here's an example processor configuration with noted possible values:

```json
{
  "type": "include",
  possible
  values: include,
  exclude
  "condition": "<xpath expression>",
  "exists": "<xpath expression>",
  "missingornull": "fail"
  possible
  values: fail,
  include,
  exclude
}
```

### filterfieldpayload

Works in the same way as [filterfieldkey](#filterfieldkey), except that its applied to `Record.Payload.After`.

### hoistfieldkey

- If the key is raw and has a schema attached, wraps it using the specified field name in a struct.
- If the key is raw and has no schema, transforms it into structured data by creating a map with the hoisted field and
  raw data as the value.
- If the key is structured, wraps it using the specified field name in a map.

### hoistfieldpayload

`hoistfieldpayload` builds the same processor as [hoistfieldkey](#hoistfieldkey), except that it operates on the field
`Record.Payload.After`.

### httprequest

`httprequest` replaces a record's `Payload.After` field with the response of the HTTP request. The response body is
wrapped in `RawData`.

#### Configuration

- `url`: URL used in the HTTP request
- `method`: HTTP request method to be used. Default: `POST`.
- `backoffRetry.count`: maximum number of retries when backing off following an error. Default: 0.
- `backoffRetry.factor`: the multiplying factor for each increment step. Default: 2 
- `backoffRetry.min`: minimum waiting time before retrying. Default: 100 milliseconds.
- `backoffRetry.max`: maximum waiting time before retrying. Default: 5 seconds.
