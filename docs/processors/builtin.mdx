:::note
Note that all built-in processors that operate on the payload actually operate on `Record.Payload.After`.
If you need to manipulate the field `Record.Payload.Before` you can use
a [JavaScript processor](./javascript-processors).
:::

Below is a list of available built-in processors in Conduit. An example usage of a built-in processor is available in
[`extract-field-transform.sh`](https:github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/blob/main/examples/processors/extract-field-transform.sh).
The script will run Conduit with a pipeline containing the built-in `extractfieldpayload` processor.

### extractfieldkey

- If the key is raw and has a schema attached, extracts the field and uses it to replace the entire key.
- If the key is raw and has no schema, returns an error (not supported).
- If the key is structured, extracts the field and uses it to replace the entire key.

#### Configuration

- `field` (Required)

  Name of the field which replaces the entire key.

### extractfieldpayload

Works in the same way as [extractfieldkey](#extractfieldkey), except that it's applied to `Record.Payload.After`.

### filterfieldkey

`filterfieldkey` includes or excludes records (i.e. drops them from the pipeline) using an XPath expression.

#### Configuration

- `type` (Required)

  Sets the behavior to "include" or "exclude" the record based on the result of the condition. Possible values
  are: `include`, `exclude`.
- `condition` (Required, XPath expression)

  An XPath query expression that the user defines to forward or drop a record on its results.
- `missingornull` (Optional)

  Defines how to handle the record in the event the fields the query would use don't exist. Possible values
  are: `fail`, `include`, `exclude`. Defaults to `fail`.
- `exists` (Optional)

  Gives the user a chance to define an existence query for a given filter. Possible values
  are: `fail`, `include`, `exclude`. Defaults to `fail`.

If `condition` passes, then it will immediately handle the record as `type` dictates. If `condition` doesn't match
and `exists` matches nothing, then it will handle the record as `missingornull` specifies.

### filterfieldpayload

Works in the same way as [filterfieldkey](#filterfieldkey), except that it's applied to `Record.Payload.After`.

### hoistfieldkey

- If the key is raw and has a schema attached, wraps it using the specified field name in a struct.
- If the key is raw and has no schema, transforms it into structured data by creating a map with the hoisted field and
  raw data as the value.
- If the key is structured, wraps it using the specified field name in a map.

#### Configuration

- `field` (Required)

  Name of the field which replaces the entire key.

### hoistfieldpayload

`hoistfieldpayload` builds the same processor as [hoistfieldkey](#hoistfieldkey), except that it operates on the field
`Record.Payload.After`.

### httprequest

`httprequest` replaces a record's `Payload.After` field with the response of the HTTP request. The response body is
wrapped in `RawData`.

#### Configuration

- `url` (Required)

  URL used in the HTTP request.
- `method` (Optional)

  HTTP request method to be used. Defaults to `POST`.
- `backoffRetry.count` (Optional, integer)

  Maximum number of retries when backing off following an error. Defaults to 0.
- `backoffRetry.factor` (Optional, integer)

  The multiplying factor for each increment step. Defaults to 2.
- `backoffRetry.min` (Optional, [duration string](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration))

  Minimum waiting time before retrying. Defaults to `100ms`.
- `backoffRetry.max` (Optional, [duration string](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration))

  Maximum waiting time before retrying. Defaults to `5s`.

### insertfieldkey

Inserts a field into key. It's possible to insert a static value or the record's position.

- If the key is raw and has a schema attached, insert the field(s) in the key data.
- If the key is raw and has no schema, return an error (not supported).
- If the key is structured, set the field(s) in the key data.

#### Configuration

- `static.field` (Required, if `position.field` is not set)

  Name of the field into which the value in `static.value` will be inserted.
- `static.value` (Required, if `static.field` is set)

  Value to be inserted.
- `position.field` (Required, if `static.field` is not set)

  Name of the field into which the record's position will be inserted.

### insertfieldpayload

Works in the same way as [insertfieldkey](#insertfieldkey), except that it's applied to `Record.Payload.After`.

### maskfieldkey

`maskfieldkey` replaces a field in a key with structured data with the zero value of its type. If the field is a string,
an interger, or a float it's possible to define a replacement value.

Raw keys (with or without schema) are not supported yet.

#### Configuration

- `field` (Required)

  Name of the field to be masked.
- `replacement` (Optional)

  Replacement value. Defaults to the field type's zero value (e.g. empty string for strings, 0 for integers etc.)

### maskfieldpayload

Works in the same way as [maskfieldpayload](#maskfieldpayload), except that it's applied to `Record.Payload.After`.

### parsejsonkey

Transforms the record's key into structured data, i.e. a JSON object.

### parsejsonpayload

Transforms the record's `Payload.After` into structured data, i.e. a JSON object.

### replacefieldkey

ReplaceFieldKey builds a processor which replaces a field in the key in raw data with a schema or in structured data.
Raw data without a schema is not supported.

#### Configuration

At least one of the following parameters is required.

- `exclude`

  A comma separated list of fields that should be excluded from the processed record (`exclude` takes precedence
  over `include`).
- `include`

  A comma separated list of fields that should be included in the processed record.
- `rename`

  A comma separated list of pairs separated by colons, that controls the mapping of old field names to new field names.

If `include` is not configured or is empty then all fields in the record will be included by default (except if they are
configured in `exclude`). If `include` is not empty, then all fields are excluded by default and only fields
in `include` will be added to the processed record.

### replacefieldpayload

Works in the same way as [replacefieldkey](#replacefieldkey), except that it's applied to `Record.Payload.After`.
