title: 'Referencing record fields'

Very often, processors can be configured to work on a specific field in a
record (which is always in
the [OpenCDC format](/docs/features/opencdc-record)). That is done through
_field references_, strings that describe the path to a field in a record. That
can be a field within an OpenCDC record (such as the metadata or the payload),
but it can also be a nested field, as we will see in the examples below.

To reference one of the OpenCDC record fields, the following should be used:

* `.Position`
* `.Operation`
* `.Key`
* `.Metadata`
* `.Payload`

To access a key in a map (e.g. the metadata) or a field in a structured field (
e.g. a payload's `After` field), the dot, or the bracket notation can be used.
The bracket notation is useful when the key name contains non-alphanumeric
characters. The following examples demonstrate that:

* `.Metadata.foo` references the value associated with the key `foo` in a
  record's metadata.
* `.Metadata["foo bar"]` references the value associated with the key `foo bar`
  in a record's metadata. The dot notation (i.e. `.Metadata.foo bar`)cannot be
  used here because the referenced key `foo bar` contains a non-alphanumeric
  character (the space).
* `.Payload.After.foo` references the field `foo` in the `After` field of a
  record's payload. This is possible only if `After`'s type
  is `opencdc.StructuredData`.
* Arbitrary nesting is possible. Let's assume we have the following record:
  ```go
  opencdc.Record{
      Payload: opencdc.Change{
          After: opencdc.StructuredData{
              "foo": map[string]interface{}{
                  "bar baz": "qux",
              },
          },
      },
  }
  ```
  The reference `.Payload.After.foo["bar baz"]` will return the value `qux`.
