Many builtin processors can be configured to work on a specific field in an
[OpenCDC record](/docs/features/opencdc-record). That is done through
_field references_, strings that describe the path to a field in a record. That
can be a field within an OpenCDC record (such as the metadata or the payload),
but it can also be a nested field, as we will see in the examples below.

To reference one of the OpenCDC record fields, the following should be used:

* `.Position`
* `.Operation`
* `.Key`
* `.Metadata`
* `.Payload.Before`
* `.Payload.After`

To access a key in a map (i.e. `.Metadata`) or a field in a structured field (
i.e. `.Key`, `.Payload.Before` or `.Payload.After`), the dot or the bracket
notation can be used. The bracket notation is useful when the key name contains
non-alphanumeric characters.

## Examples

Below is an example OpenCDC record (left) and the field references that can be
used to access the fields in the record (right):

<table style={{backgroundColor: "#282A36"}}>
    <tr>
        <td>
```json showLineNumbers
{
    "position": "c3RhbmRpbmc=",
    "operation": "update",
    "metadata": {
        "foo": "bar",
        "opencdc.readAt": "1663858188836816000"
    },
    "key": "cGFkbG9jay1rZXk=",
    "payload": {
        "before": "eWVsbG93",
        "after": {
            "boolField": true,
            "nested": {
                "non-alphanumeric key!": "baz"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
        </td>
        <td>
```text
.
.Position
.Operation
.Metadata
.Metadata.foo / .Metadata["foo"]
.Metadata["opencdc.readAt"]

.Key
.Payload
.Payload.Before
.Payload.After
.Payload.After.boolField / .Payload.After["boolField"]
.Payload.After.nested / .Payload.After["nested"]
.Payload.After.nested["non-alphanumeric key!"] / .Payload.After["nested"]["non-alphanumeric key!"]




```
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

A few things to note:

* `.` references the entire record (i.e. the JSON object above).
* Fields `.Key` and `.Payload.Before` contain raw data (i.e. byte arrays), which
  is represented as a base64-encoded string. We can not reference nested fields
  in raw data. However, if the raw data is first parsed into structured data (e.g.
  if it's a JSON string we can use the
  [`json.decode`](/docs/processors/builtin/json.decode) processor), then we can
  reference the fields in the structured data.
* `.Metadata["opencdc.readAt"]` references the field on line 6 using the bracket
  notation. The dot notation (i.e. `.Metadata.opencdc.readAt`) cannot be used
  here because the referenced key `opencdc.readAt` contains a non-alphanumeric
  character (the dot).
