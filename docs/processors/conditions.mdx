Even when a [processor](/docs/connectors/getting-started) is attached to a connector or to a pipeline, we might want to include some conditions that need to be met for the processor to be executed at all.

This can be accomplished by adding the `condition` key to the processor definition in our [Pipeline Configuration File](/docs/pipeline-configuration-files).


:::warning
This condition will use the [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) format, and when returned value of this expression returns **true**, then the processor will be executed, otherwise it will be skipped. This effectively mean that by default all records will be processed unless the condition is met.
:::

## Example of a condition

Here's an example of a simple condition. In this case, records **won't** be processed by the `json.decode` builtin processsor when the [OpenCDC Metadata](/docs/features/opencdc-record#fields) contains a key named `unexpected-key`.


```yaml
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: example-pipeline
    connectors:
    # define source and destination connectors
    # ...
    processors:
      - id: extract-name
        plugin: json.decode
        settings:
          field: name
        condition: `{{ eq .Metadata.key "unexpected-key" }}`
```
