Even when a [processor](/docs/connectors/getting-started) is attached to a connector or to a pipeline, we might want to include some conditions that need to be met for the processor to be executed at all.

This can be accomplished by adding the `condition` key to the processor definition in our [Pipeline Configuration File](/docs/pipeline-configuration-files).


## What conditions are allowed

This `condition` key will use the [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) format, which means that any function provided by [sprig](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) can be used as a condition.

When a returned value of this expression is **true**, then the processor will be executed, otherwise it will be skipped. This effectively means that by default all records will be processed unless the condition is met.

:::warning
Conduit will parse the output of the go template using [`strconv.ParseBool`](https://pkg.go.dev/strconv#ParseBool) which means that `1`, `t`, `T`, `TRUE`, `true` and `True` will all evaluate to `true`, while `0`, `f`, `F`, `FALSE`, `false`, `False` will be evaluated to `false`.

## Example of a condition

Here's an example of a simple condition. In this case, records **will** be processed by the `json.decode` builtin processsor when the [OpenCDC Metadata](/docs/features/opencdc-record#fields) contains a key named `key` which value is equal to `unexpected-value`.


```yaml
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: example-pipeline
    connectors:
    # define source and destination connectors
    # ...
    processors:
      - id: extract-name
        plugin: json.decode
        settings:
          field: .Payload.After.name
        condition: `{{ eq .Metadata.key "unexpected-value" }}`
```
