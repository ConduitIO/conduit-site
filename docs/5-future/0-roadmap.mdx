Conduit works in the open and we're always looking for feedback from the community. Our roadmap is publicly available at GitHub [on this project](https://github.com/orgs/ConduitIO/projects/3/views/9).

### Need a connector

If you need support for a particular data store that doesn't exist on the Connector list, check out the list of
requested [source connectors](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aconnector%3Asource+is%3Aopen) and the list of requested [destination connectors](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aconnector%3Adestination+is%3Aopen).

Give the issue a `+1` if you really need that connector. The upvote will help the team understand demand for any
particular connector. If you find that an issue hasn't been created for your data store, please create a new issue in
the Conduit repo.
