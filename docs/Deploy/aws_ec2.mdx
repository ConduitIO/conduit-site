# Deploying to Amazon EC2

Before you get started, Conduit should not be listening on any ports that are accessible to the public Internet. In this guide will we'll set up a Conduit instance that can be reached through the public Internet via SSH. We'll start at the top with a fresh AWS Account. In the end, the topology will look like this:

## Launch a new EC2 Instance in your VPC

We recommend using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI, SSD Volume Type as the base for your instance. A t2.medium instance is sufficient for most production setups.

## Install Conduit on the Instance

First we're going to need to download the latest released version of Conduit. You can go the releases page on the Conduit repo in GitHub and find the version that you need, or you can copy and paste this command on the machine to do it for you:

```shell
$ TAG=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/latest | grep "tag_name\": \"v[0-9.]*" | grep -oE '[.0-9]+') && curl -o conduit.tgz -L "https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/download/v${TAG}/conduit_${TAG}_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz"
```

### What's going on in that command

There's a lot going on in that command. Let's break it down. The first part will find what the latest version is and put it into a variable:

```shell
$ TAG=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/latest | grep "tag_name\": \"v[0-9.]*" | grep -oE '[.0-9]+')
```

Once we've got the variable, it gets used in the next part which will download the specific version number from the GitHub downloads for Linux. If you needed to do this for a different operating system (Windows or Darwin), you'd change that in the file name. A `.tgz` file will then be downloaded to your machine.

```bash
$ curl -o conduit.tgz -L "https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/download/v${TAG}/conduit_${TAG}_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz"
```

### Finish up Installation

Now that we've got `conduit.tgz` downloaded, we need to expand the archive:

```bash
$ tar zxvf conduit.tgz
x LICENSE.md
x README.md
x conduit
```

Then we can copy the `conduit` binary to a place where it can be accessed by the system. We'll put it in `/usr/bin`.

```bash
$ cp conduit /usr/bin
```

Conduit has now been installed on your EC2 instance but we're not quite done. Let's set up a few more configuration items before we start running pipelines.


## Add Conduit to Systemd

Any time the machine needs to restart or if the process fails, you'll want the machine to restart Conduit. Let's add some configuration to `systemd` to make sure that this happens. First, we'll want to add a startup script to the machine. Assuming, you have a terminal session connected to the instance, you can run this command:

```bash
$ echo
```

Now that we have the script ready to go, we can add Conduit to `systemd`:

```bash
$ systemctl
```

Great! Conduit is now being managed by the operating system. Any time you have a restart or something else, Conduit will automatically be restarted.

If you are choosing to use a different Linux distro than the one provided by Amazon, you may be working with a different init and system manager. How to add Conduit to other managers is outside the scope of this guide.

## Connect to Conduit

Now that Conduit is running on the EC2 instance within your VPC, you'll need to connect to it via SSH and the forward a port from your machine to the Conduit instance.

Let's start by connecting to the instance:

```shell
$
```

You're now able to create pipelines!
