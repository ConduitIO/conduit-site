# Deploying Conduit

Where can you deploy conduit?
- Locally on your machine.
- In a cloud environment.
- In a private cloud environment.
- In a private cloud environment with a custom network.
- Anywhere, you can run a [Go](https://go.dev/) binary.

## Docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) enables you to run Conduit as in a container. Conduit's Docker images are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/pkgs/container/conduit). You can find the `Dockerfile` [here](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/blob/main/Dockerfile).

After you install Docker, you can pull the Conduit image by running the following command:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/conduitio/conduit:latest
```
Then, you can run Conduit by running the following command:

```shell
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/conduitio/conduit
```

**Helpful Tip:** If you're using Docker, check out [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/). After we push an update, Watchtower will keep your Conduit container updated by gracefully shutting down your existing container and restarting it with the same options used when initially deployed.
