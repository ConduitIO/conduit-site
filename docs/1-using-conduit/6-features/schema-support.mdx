## Overview

Conduit can manage the structure and format of data as it moves through the
pipeline. This makes it possible to take advantage of the benefits that the
associated type information provides, such as:

- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring that data adheres to the expected structure, reducing
  the risk of errors and inconsistencies.
- **Type Safety**: Retaining type information throughout the data pipeline, allowing
  for safe and accurate data processing.
- **Future-Proofing**: Preparing the system to handle evolving data structures,
  making it easier to adapt to changes without significant disruptions.

Additionally, this solves the problem of transferring type information in
standalone connectors. Namely, Conduit and standalone connectors communicate via
Protobuf messages that have a limited set of types.

Every [record](/docs/features/opencdc-record) that contains structured
data can be associated with a schema.
The [Apache Avroâ„¢](https://avro.apache.org/) format is supported and support for
more schema types is planned.

Since both, a record's key and payload, can be structured, schemas can be
associated with either. Schemas are not part of a record for performance
reasons. Instead, a record's metadata contains information about
the [key schema](/docs/features/opencdc-record#opencdckeyschema)'s subject and
version as well
the [payload schema](/docs/features/opencdc-record#opencdcpayloadschema)'s
subject and version. The schemas themselves are managed
by [the schema registry](#schema-registry).

Conduit's [Connector SDK](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-sdk) and [Processor SDK](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-processor-sdk) make it possible to:

- automatically extract a schema from a record's key or payload (note that the
  data has to be structured)
- automatically encode or decode a record's key or payload (i.e. connectors and
  processors can work with structured data that contain correct types without
  being involved in fetching the schemas and encoding/decoding the data
  themselves)
- work directly with the schema registry (for example, in cases where automatic
  schema extraction isn't enough and a schema needs to be built manually using
  the information from a source)

More information about how to work with schemas can be found in the relevant
pages
for [source connectors](/docs/connectors/building-connectors/developing-source-connectors), [destination connectors](/docs/connectors/building-connectors/developing-destination-connectors)
and [processors](/docs/processors/standalone/building#schemas).

## Schema Registry

Conduit uses a schema registry to store the schemas of records.
You can either configure Conduit to use the built-in schema registry (default) or to
connect to an external standalone service exposing a REST API that's compatible
with [Confluent's Schema registry](https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/develop/api.html).

To use an external schema registry, you can use the following configuration
options in your [Conduit configuration file](/docs/features/configuration).

```yaml
schema-registry:
  type: confluent
  confluent:
    connection-string: http://localhost:8081
```

Or when running Conduit from the command line you can use the following flags:

```shell
$ ./conduit 
  -schema-registry.type=confluent 
  -schema-registry.confluent.connection-string=http://localhost:8081
```

When using a **built-in schema registry**, schemas will be stored in the
same [**persistence layer**](/docs/getting-started/architecture#persistence-layer) as the rest of
Conduit's data. By default, it uses BadgerDB, but it can be configured to use
PostgreSQL, SQLite, or in-memory storage. More information
on [storage](/docs/features/storage).
