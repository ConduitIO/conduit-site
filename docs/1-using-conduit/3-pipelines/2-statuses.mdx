Understanding the different statuses of your pipeline is crucial for effective monitoring and management. Below are the various statuses that a pipeline can have in Conduit.

## Statuses Overview

| Status                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Running**            | The pipeline is actively processing data and functioning as expected.      |
| **Stopped**            | The pipeline has been stopped by the system, or manually by a user. |
| **Degraded**           | The pipeline is running but is experiencing issues that may affect performance. |
| **Recovering**         | The pipeline is in the process of recovering from a degraded state or error. |

## Status Descriptions

### Running
-  **Definition**: The pipeline is currently active and processing data without any issues.
-  **Implication**: All systems are functioning normally, and data is flowing as expected.

### Stopped
-  **Definition**: The pipeline has been halted by the system, or manually stopped by a user.
-  **Implication**: No data is being processed. Check system logs for more information on the cause. Pipeline could be re-started.

### Degraded
-  **Definition**: The pipeline is operational but experiencing issues that may impact its performance.
-  **Implication**: While data is still being processed, you may notice slower performance or errors. Investigate the cause to restore full functionality.

### Recovering
-  **Definition**: The pipeline is in the process of recovering from a degraded state or error.
-  **Implication**: The system is attempting to restore normal operations. Monitor the status to ensure recovery is successful.
