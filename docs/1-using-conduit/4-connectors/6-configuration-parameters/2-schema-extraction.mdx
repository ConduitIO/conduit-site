title: "Schema Extraction"
---

Source and destination connectors can be configured to automatically extract the
schema from the key and payload of a record. This is especially useful when the
data is structured and the schema is known in advance. By default, Conduit
extracts the schema from the key and the payload of a record and encodes them
using the extracted schema.

## Configuration parameters

These are the configuration parameters that control schema extraction on a
source connector (Note that `sdk.schema.extract.payload.enabled`
and `sdk.schema.extract.key.enabled` are also available on destination
connectors):

* `sdk.schema.extract.type`: The type of schema extraction to perform. Supported
  value is `avro`.
* `sdk.schema.extract.payload.enabled`: A boolean value that indicates whether
  the payload should be extracted.
* `sdk.schema.extract.payload.subject`: The subject of the payload schema.
* `sdk.schema.extract.key.enabled`: A boolean value that indicates whether the
  key should be extracted.
* `sdk.schema.extract.key.subject`: The subject of the key schema.


:::caution
`sdk.schema.extract.payload.enabled` and `sdk.schema.extract.key.enabled` should be set to `false` when producing raw (not structured) data, as shown in the example below. 

If you are developing a connector, you can disable this automatically by updating the connector's default middleware. For more information about `NewSource()` when developing a source connector, see [here](/docs/connectors/building-connectors/developing-source-connectors/#newsource).

## Example

The below pipeline will generate a single record and write it to a file. Notice
that it's configured so that the generator source does not extract the schema or
encode the data.

```yaml
version: "2.2"
pipelines:
  - id: generator-to-file
    status: running
    name: generator-to-file
    description: Generates a single record, no schema generated, writes to file
    connectors:
      - id: file-src
        type: source
        plugin: builtin:generator
        name: file-src
        settings:
          recordCount: "1"
          collections.users.format.type: structured
          collections.users.format.options.id: int
          collections.users.format.options.name: string

          sdk.schema.extract.payload.enabled: false
          sdk.schema.extract.key.enabled: false

      - id: file-dest
        type: destination
        plugin: builtin:file
        name: file-dest
        settings:
          path: /tmp/file-destination.txt
```

When the pipeline is run, `/tmp/file-destination.txt` will contain output similar to this:

```json
{
  "position": "MQ==",
  "operation": "create",
  "metadata": {
    "conduit.source.connector.id": "generator-to-file:file-src",
    "opencdc.collection": "users",
    "opencdc.createdAt": "1723046776830339829"
  },
  "key": "c2F1cm9wc2lkYW4=",
  "payload": {
    "before": null,
    "after": {
      "id": 7819649577989235000,
      "name": "Iambe"
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that the written record doesn't contain any schema information in its
metadata. However, if you leave the schema extraction enabled, then you'll see
something below in the record's metadata:

```
"opencdc.payload.schema.subject": "generator-to-file:file-src:users.payload",
"opencdc.payload.schema.version": "1"
```
