A connector is an external process which communicates with Conduit and knows how
to read/write records from/to a data source/destination (e.g. a database).

When thinking about connectors for Conduit, our goals were to:
- provide a good development experience to connector developers,
- ship Conduit with real built-in connectors (compiled into the Conduit binary),
- to make it as easy as possible to write plugins in _any_ programming language,
- the [Connector SDK](https://github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk) to be
  decoupled from Conduit and be able to change without changing Conduit itself.

Have a look at our [connector docs](/docs/connectors/installing-connectors) to
