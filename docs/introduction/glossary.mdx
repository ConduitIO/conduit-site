* **Pipeline** - a pipeline receives records from one or multiple source connectors, pushes them through zero or
  multiple processors until they reach one or multiple destination connectors.
* **Connector** - a connector is the internal entity that communicates with a connector plugin and either pushes records
  from the plugin into the pipeline (source connector) or the other way around (destination connector).
* **Connector plugin** - sometimes also referred to as "plugin", is an external process which communicates with Conduit
  and knows how to read/write records from/to a data source/destination (e.g. a database).
* **Processor** - a component that executes an operation on a single record that flows through the pipeline. It can
  either change the record or filter it out based on some criteria.
* **Record** - a record represents a single piece of data that flows through a pipeline (e.g. one database row).
