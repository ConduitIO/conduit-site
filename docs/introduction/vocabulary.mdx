* **Pipeline** - a pipeline receives records from one or multiple source
  connectors, pushes them through zero or multiple processors until they reach
  one or multiple destination connectors.
* **Connector** - a connector is the internal entity that communicates with a
  connector plugin and either pushes records from the plugin into the pipeline
  (source connector) or the other way around (destination connector).
* **Connector plugin** - sometimes also referred to as "plugin", is an external
  process which communicates with Conduit and knows how to read/write records
  from/to a data source/destination (e.g. a database).
* **Processor** - a component that executes an operation on a single record that
  flows through the pipeline. It can either change the record or filter it out
  based on some criteria.
* **Record** - a record represents a single piece of data that flows through a
  pipeline (e.g. one database row).
* **Collection** - a generic term used in Conduit to describe an entity in a
  3rd party system from which records are read from or to which records they are
  written to. Examples are: topics (in Kafka), tables (in a database), indexes (
  in a search engine), collections (in NoSQL databases), etc.
