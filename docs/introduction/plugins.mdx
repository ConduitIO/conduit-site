A plugin is an external process which communicates with Conduit and knows how to read/write records from/to a data source/destination (e.g. a database).

When thinking about plugins for Conduit, our goals were to:
- provide a good development experience to plugin developers. 
- ship Conduit with real built-in plugins (compiled into the Conduit binary),
- to make it as easy as possible to write plugins in _any_ programming language 
- the Plugin SDK to be decoupled from Conduit and be able to change without changing Conduit itself.

As we work on "How to build a plugin" documentation, you may view the [Conduit Plugin Architecture](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/blob/main/docs/architecture-decision-records/20220121-conduit-plugin-architecture.md).
