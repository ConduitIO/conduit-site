While Conduit is built on strong foundations and experiences from running similar systems, it's not production ready
at the moment. Following features are on the roadmap and yet to be implemented:

1. Standard record format - we plan to have the records implement a single standard for CDC events.
2. Delivery and ordering guarantees - from the experience we have so far, messages created internally are reliably delivered through
   Conduit (from source nodes, over processing nodes to destination nodes). However, we still need good end-to-end, full-scale
   tests to actually prove that.
3. Performance guarantees (for the core) - reasons are identical to reasons for delivery guarantees.
4. Dynamic loading of list of plugins - currently, the API cannot return the list of all available plugins and the available
   configuration parameters. Consequently, the UI has the plugin paths and configuration parameters hard-coded.
