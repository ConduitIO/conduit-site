title: 'Referencing Record Fields'

Many builtin processors can be configured to work on a specific field in an
[OpenCDC record](/docs/features/opencdc-record). That is done through
_field references_, strings that describe the path to a field in a record. That
can be a field within an OpenCDC record (such as the metadata or the payload),
but it can also be a [nested field](#accessing-nested-fields).

To reference one of the OpenCDC record fields, you can use a similar notation to
accessing fields in a [Go template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)
executed on an [`opencdc.Record`](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-commons/blob/v0.1.1/opencdc/record.go#L30)
value. For example, `.Metadata` will reference the field named
`Metadata`.

:::tip[Why do record fields start with an uppercase letter?]

The main record fields start with an uppercase letter, because they are public
fields in the Go type [`opencdc.Record`](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-commons/blob/v0.1.1/opencdc/record.go#L30)
which is used to resolve field references (e.g. `Metadata`, `Position`,
`Operation`, `Key`, `Payload`).

:::

## Accessing Nested Fields

Nested fields can be accessed using two different notations: the **dot notation**
and the **bracket notation**:

* The **dot notation** is used to access fields containing only alphanumeric
  characters. For example, the reference `.Metadata.foo` will access the
  field named `foo` in the `Metadata` field.
* The **bracket notation** is used to access fields containing non-alphanumeric
  characters. For example, the reference `.Metadata["opencdc.readAt"]` will
  access the field named `opencdc.readAt` in the `Metadata` field.

## Examples

Below is an example OpenCDC record (left) and the field references that can be
used to access the fields in the record (right):

<table style={{backgroundColor: "#282A36"}}>
    <tr>
        <td>
```json title="Example OpenCDC record"
{
    "position": "c3RhbmRpbmc=",
    "operation": "update",
    "metadata": {
        "foo": "bar",
        "opencdc.readAt": "1663858188836816000"
    },
    "key": "cGFkbG9jay1rZXk=",
    "payload": {
        "before": "eWVsbG93",
        "after": {
            "boolField": true,
            "nested": {
                "non-alphanumeric key!": "baz"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
        </td>
        <td>
```json title="Field references per line"
.
.Position
.Operation
.Metadata
.Metadata.foo / .Metadata["foo"]
.Metadata["opencdc.readAt"]

.Key
.Payload
.Payload.Before
.Payload.After
.Payload.After.boolField / .Payload.After["boolField"]
.Payload.After.nested / .Payload.After["nested"]
.Payload.After.nested["non-alphanumeric key!"] / .Payload.After["nested"]["non-alphanumeric key!"]




```
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

A few things to note:

* `.` references the entire record (i.e. the JSON object above).
* Fields `.Key` and `.Payload.Before` contain raw data (i.e. byte arrays), which
  is represented as a base64-encoded string. We can not reference nested fields
  in raw data. However, if the raw data is first parsed into structured data (e.g.
  if it's a JSON string we can use the
  [`json.decode`](/docs/processors/builtin/json.decode) processor), then we can
  reference the fields in the structured data.
* `.Metadata["opencdc.readAt"]` references the metadata field `opencdc.readAt`
  using the bracket notation. The dot notation (i.e. `.Metadata.opencdc.readAt`)
  cannot be used here because the referenced key `opencdc.readAt` contains a
  non-alphanumeric character (the dot).
* Note that references to fields nested inside `.Key`, `.Payload.Before` and
  `.Payload.After` **do not** start with an uppercase letter, because these
  fields are not part of the
  [`opencdc.Record`](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-commons/blob/v0.1.1/opencdc/record.go#L30)
  type. They are referenced by their actual names, as they appear in JSON.
