Conduit connectors can be built in any programming language that supports gRPC.
To make it easier to write connectors we provide
a [Connector SDK](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-sdk) written in
Go. Using the SDK is the recommended way of writing a Conduit connector.

## Conduit connector template

The easiest way to start implementing your own Conduit connector is by using the
[Conduit connector template](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-template).
It contains the basic project structure as well as some additional utilities
like GitHub actions and a Makefile.

Find out more about the template and how to use it in the readme.
