title: "Adding built-in Connectors"

Built-in connectors offer better performance when compared to standalone ones,
which is why in some cases it's desirable to have a custom build of Conduit that
includes additional built-in connectors.

The simplest way to achieve so is to write a small application that embeds
Conduit (i.e. uses Conduit as a library) and adds one or more connectors to its
default configuration.

In the example below we will add
the [HTTP connector](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-http)
to Conduit as a built-in connector.

First, we initialize a Go module with `go mod init github.com/conduitio-labs/custom-conduit`.

Then , we need to add Conduit and the HTTP connector as dependencies:
```shell
go get github.com/conduitio/conduit
go get github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-http
go mod tidy
```

Once that is done, we need to write a `main` function that:
1. Adds the HTTP connector the default Conduit configuration
2. Runs Conduit with the custom configuration.

That's done in the code below:

```go
package main

import (
	http "github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-http"
	"github.com/conduitio/conduit/pkg/conduit"
)

func main() {
	// Get the default configuration, including all built-in connectors
	cfg := conduit.DefaultConfig()

	// Add the HTTP connector to list of built-in connectors
	cfg.ConnectorPlugins["http"] = http.Connector

	conduit.Serve(cfg)
}
```

The "custom Conduit" can be built with `go build main.go -o custom-conduit`. If
you run the built binary, you can check that the HTTP connector has been
included in the build by listing all the connector plugins: 
```shell
curl 'http://localhost:8080/v1/connectors/plugins'

[
  {
    "name": "builtin:http@(devel)",
    "summary": "HTTP source and destination connectors for Conduit.",
    "description": "Conduit HTTP source and destination connectors, they connect to an HTTP URL and send HTTP requests.",
    "version": "(devel)",
    "author": "",
    "destinationParams": {},
    "sourceParams": {}
  }
  // other plugins
]
```
