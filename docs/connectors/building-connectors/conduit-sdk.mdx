Conduit connectors can be built in any programming language that supports gRPC.
To make it easier to write connectors we provide
a [Connector SDK](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-sdk) written in
Go. Using the SDK is the recommended way of writing a Conduit connector.

## Supported data types

There are no limitations when it comes to data types a source connector can read
from a source. However, if a standalone source connector uses `record.StructuredData`
in its key or any part of the payload, then there are certain limitations in the
data types it can send to Conduit.

The following data types are supported:

* `bool`
* `int`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint`, `uint32`, `uint64`
* `float32`, `float64`
* `string`
* `[]byte` (stored as a string, base64-encoded)
* `map[string]interface{}` (a map of strings to any of the values that are supported)
* `[]interface{}` (a slice of any value that is supported)

A notable limitation is timestamps, i.e. `time.Time` values are not supported.

One way to support other values is to encode source data to a `[]byte` (e.g. using
a JSON encoding) and then store the value as `record.RawData`.


## Conduit connector template

The easiest way to start implementing your own Conduit connector is by using the
[Conduit connector template](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-template).
It contains the basic project structure as well as some additional utilities
like GitHub actions and a Makefile.

Find out more about the template and how to use it in the readme.
