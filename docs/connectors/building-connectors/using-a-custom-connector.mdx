## Adding the Connector to Conduit

The Conduit Connector template includes a `Makefile` that can be used to build a binary version of your connector.

```bash
make build
```

After the command runs you should see a binary file with the name of the connector in the local directory.

To run the Connector, you will need to move it to a directory that Conduit can access.  By default, this directory is the `connectors` directory located alongside the Conduit binary.  Move your newly created Connector binary into the `connectors` directory and run Conduit using the following command:

```bash
./conduit
```

Navigate to the Conduit UI (by default located at [http://localhost:8080/ui](http://localhost:8080/ui) while Conduit is running) to see your Connector in the list of available Connectors

## Using the Connector in a Conduit Pipeline

Although you can use the Connector directly within the Conduit UI, the recommended way to use the Connector is define a [pipeline configuration file](/docs/pipeline-configuration-files/getting-started.mdx).
When using custom Connectors in a pipeline configuration, they are prefixed with phrase 'standalone' unlike built in Connectors which are prefixed with 'builtin'. For example, to use a custom Connector named `file-sync` it would look as follows: `plugin: standalone:file-sync@[replace-with-connector-version]`.

More information about [Referencing Connectors](/docs/connectors/referencing.mdx).

Below is an example of using a custom Connector in a pipeline configuration file:

``` yaml title="pipelines/use-custom-connector.yml"
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: use-custom-connector
    # run pipeline on startup
    status: running
    description: >
      Example pipeline reading to use a custom file sync connector.

    connectors:
      - id: source-sync
        type: source
        # use the custom file-sync plugin as the source
        plugin: standalone:file-sync@v0.1.0
        settings:
          # use ./data as the directory input to the file-sync connector; the connnector will watch for new files in this directory
          directory: ./data

      - id: destination-sync
        type: destination
        # use the custom file-sync plugin as the destination
        plugin: standalone:file-sync@v0.1.0
        settings:
        # use ./new_destination as the directory input to the file-sync connector; the connnector will write files from the pipeline to this directory
          directory: ./new_destination
```
