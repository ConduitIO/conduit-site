There are no limitations when it comes to data types a source connector can read
from a source. Certain type limitations might apply depending on how the data is
moved internally in Conduit, from source connector to Conduit and from Conduit
to destination connectors.

All the data read by Conduit is represented
by [OpenCDC records](/docs/features/opencdc-record), most important parts of
which are the key and the payload. The key and the payload data can be
represented in two ways: raw data and structured data.

## Raw data

Raw data in Conduit is an array of bytes that can represent the source data in
its original form (such as a file) or encoded in a certain way (for example, a
JSON representation of a database row or an Avro encoded structure). It's
represented by the `opencdc.RawData` Go type. For example, when writing a
connector or a processor in Go, you can construct raw data like this:

```go
opencdc.RawData([]byte{1, 3, 5})
```

## Structured data

Structured data in Conduit is a map in which the keys are field names and values
are field values. The supported data types for field values depend on two
things: connector type (built-in, standalone) and [schema support](/docs/features/schema-support) (schema
middleware enabled or disabled).

In built-in connectors, the field values can be of any Go type, given that
there's no (de)serialization involved.

In standalone connectors with schema middleware enabled (which is the default),
any type that is supported by the [Apache Avroâ„¢ format](https://avro.apache.org)
is also supported by Conduit.

If the schema middleware is disabled in a connector, then the supported types
are limited to what Protobuf allows as
a [value](https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#value). That
translates to the following Go types:

* `bool`
* `int`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint`, `uint32`, `uint64`
* `float32`, `float64`
* `string`
* `[]byte` (stored as a string, base64-encoded)
* `map[string]interface{}` (a map of strings to any of the values that are supported)
* `[]interface{}` (a slice of any value that is supported)

A notable limitation is timestamps, i.e. `time.Time` values are not supported.
