There special files that should be implemented to describe your connector.

### `spec.go`

This file defines the public-facing characteristics of the connector such as its name and capabilities. Begin by updating placeholder values with the specific details of your connector.

```go
var version = "v0.1.0"

// Specification returns the connector's specification.
func Specification() sdk.Specification {
 return sdk.Specification{
  Name:        "file-sync",
  Summary:     "<describe your connector>",
  Description: "<describe your connector in detail>",
  Version:     version,
  Author:      "<your name>",
 }
}
```

### `config.go`

This file holds configuration parameters shared between source and destination, if applicable. If separate configuration is required for source and destination, distinct `config.go` files should be created for each.

```go
type Config struct {
 // Directory is the file path to the directory that will be watched for file changes
 Directory string `json:"directory" validate:"required,regex=^(/[^/ ]*)+/?$"`
}
```
