Source and destination connectors can be configured to automatically extract the schema from the key and payload of a record. This is especially useful when the data is structured and the schema is known in advance. By default, Conduit extracts the schema from the key and payload of a record.

## Configuration parameters

These are these configuration parameters that control schema extraction on a source connector (Note that `sdk.schema.extract.payload.enabled` and `sdk.schema.extract.key.enabled` are also available on destination connectors):

* `sdk.schema.extract.type`: The type of schema extraction to perform. Supported value is `avro`.
* `sdk.schema.extract.payload.enabled`: A boolean value that indicates whether the payload should be extracted.
* `sdk.schema.extract.payload.subject`: The subject of the payload schema.
* `sdk.schema.extract.key.enabled`: A boolean value that indicates whether the key should be extracted.
* `sdk.schema.extract.key.subject`: The subject of the key schema.
