Destination connectors can be configured to limit the rate at which records can be written. This is especially useful when the destination resource has a rate limit to ensure that the connector does not exceed it. By default, Conduit does not limit the rate at which records are written.

## Configuration parameters

* `sdk.rate.perSecond`: Maximum number of records written per second (0 means no rate limit).
* `sdk.rate.burst`: Allow bursts of at most X records (0 or less means that bursts are not limited). Only takes effect if a rate limit per second is set. Note that if `sdk.batch.size` is bigger than `sdk.rate.burst`, the effective batch size will be equal to `sdk.rate.burst`.

## Example

The pipeline will generate an infinite number of structured records in bursts during 5 seconds at a maximum rate, and write them to the log. When you run it, you'll notice that by using both `sdk.rate.perSecond` and `sdk.rate.burst`, the log destination connector will limit the rate of processed records 8 records per second in batches of 2 (i.e. 2 records every 250ms).
