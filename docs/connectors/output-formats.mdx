:::note

Configuring different output formats is possible for connectors which use Conduit SDK's default
middleware. Please consult the connector's documentation to confirm the feature is available.

:::

By default, Conduit uses
the [OpenCDC format](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/blob/main/docs/design-documents/20220309-opencdc.md)
to represent records when communicating with connectors. When integrating with other systems, such as Kafka Connect, a
different format is needed. Conduit makes it easy by providing built-in options to convert records to other formats and
which do not require writing custom processors.

The output format is configured at the connector level. An implication of that is that different connectors in the same
or different pipelines can use different formats, which provides additional flexibility.

There are two connector configuration parameters which control the output format: `sdk.record.format` and
`sdk.record.format.options`. `sdk.record.format` configures the format itself whereas `sdk.record.format.options` allows
the user to control specifics of the chosen format.

## Available formats

Some formats (but not all) come in the form of `type/subtype`.

`type` is the name of the converter that **controls the structure** of the produced record. `subtype` is the name of the
encoder that **controls the encoding** of the structure created by the converter. Currently, the only possible values is
`json`. More encoders are planned in future (e.g. Avro, Parquet, ...)

### `opencdc/json`

This is the default format. An extensive description of this format is
available [here](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/blob/main/docs/design-documents/20220309-opencdc.md).

#### **Options**

None.

### `debezium/json`

Produces a Debezium record.

#### **Options**

##### `debezium.schema.name`

Name of schema to be used in converted Debezium records.

**Default value**: none

##### `debezium.rawData.key`

If the record to be converted doesn't contain a structured payload or its payload cannot be parsed as JSON,
then this key defines the field into which the "raw" payload data will be put.

**Default value**: `opencdc.rawData`

### `template`

The user gets full control over the output format by using [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template). The value
provided to the template is a
[sdk.Record](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-sdk/blob/e08068428247af6e3b34bef8abffad2b758d5529/record.go#L81),
so the template has access to all its fields (e.g. .Position, .Key, .Metadata and so on). We also inject all
template functions provided by [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) to make it easier to write templates.
