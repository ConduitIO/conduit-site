Webhooks are a way for an app to provide other HTTP-based applications with real-time information. As a Meroxa destination, you can capture events from any [source](/docs/sources/overview) and trigger an HTTP request with every event.

## Getting Started

To begin sending data to Webhook, perform the following steps:

1. [Create an Account](http://dashboard.meroxa.io/) - Create an account using the [Dashboard](http://dashboard.meroxa.io/), or the [CLI](/cli/installation-guide).

2. [Add Resource](/docs/destinations/webhook/add-resource) - Add a Webhook resource to your Meroxa Resource Catalog.

3. [Create Destination Connector](docs/destinations/webhook/create-connector) - Create a connector to use Webhook as a Destination.
