This document provides insights on how Conduit communicates with a connector,
what is expected from the connector and the guarantees that Conduit provides.

## Conduit Connector Protocol

Conduit expects all connectors to follow the
[Conduit Connector Protocol](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-protocol)
. The connector protocol is a protobuf file describing the interface between
Conduit and the connector in the form of gRPC services. This approach allows
connectors to be written in any language with support for gRPC.

The connector protocol splits the connector interface in 3 gRPC services - one
for the source, another for the destination, and a third one for the connector
specifications. A connector needs to implement the specifications and at least
the source or destination.
