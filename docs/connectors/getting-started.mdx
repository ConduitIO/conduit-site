A connector knows how to read/write records from/to a data source/destination
(e.g. a database).

When thinking about connectors for Conduit, our goals were to:
- provide a good development experience to connector developers,
- ship Conduit with real built-in connectors (compiled into the Conduit binary),
- to make it as easy as possible to write plugins in _any_ programming language,
- the [Connector SDK](https://github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk) to be
  decoupled from Conduit and be able to change without changing Conduit itself.

Conduit ships with a number of built-in connectors:

- [File connector](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-file) provides
  a source/destination to read/write a local file (useful for quickly trying out
  Conduit without additional setup).
- [Kafka connector](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-kafka)
  provides a source/destination for Apache Kafka.
- [Postgres connector](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-postgres)
  provides a source/destination for PostgreSQL.
- [S3 connector](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-s3) provides a
  source/destination for AWS S3.
- [Generator connector](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-generator)
  provides a source which generates random data (useful for testing).
- [Log connector](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-log)
  provides a destination which outputs records in the Conduit logs.

Besides these connectors there is a number of standalone connectors that can be
added to Conduit as plugins (find the complete
list [here]("/docs/connectors/connector-list")).
