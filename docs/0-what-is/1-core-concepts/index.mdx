## Pipeline 

A pipeline receives records from one or multiple source connectors, pushes them through zero 
or multiple processors until they reach one or multiple destination connectors.

## Connector 

A connector is the internal entity that communicates with a connector plugin and either pushes 
records from the plugin into the pipeline (source connector) or the other way around 
(destination connector).

Conduit ships with connectors that are directly built into the service ([built-in connectors](/docs/using/connectors/getting-started/#conduit-ships-with-a-number-of-built-in-connectors)), but it can also be expanded with additional [standalone connectors](/docs/developing/connectors/).

One of the main differences between Conduit connectors and those that you might find from other services is that all Conduit connectors are **Change Data Capture-first (CDC)**.

CDC allows your pipeline to only get the changes that have happened over time instead of pulling down an entire upstream data store and then tracking diffs between some period of time. This is critical for building real-time, event-driven pipelines and applications. But, we'll note where connectors do or do not have CDC capabilities.

## Connector plugin 

Sometimes also referred to as "plugin", is an external process which communicates with Conduit 
and knows how to read/write records from/to a data source/destination (e.g. a database).

## Processor 

A component that executes an operation on a single record that flows through the pipeline. 
It can either change the record or filter it out based on some criteria.

## OpenCDC Record 

A record represents a single piece of data that flows through a pipeline (e.g. one database row). 
[More info here](/docs/using/opencdc-record).

## Collection 

A generic term used in Conduit to describe an entity in a 3rd party system from which records 
are read from or to which records they are written to. Examples are: topics (in Kafka), tables 
(in a database), indexes (in a search engine), collections (in NoSQL databases), etc.
