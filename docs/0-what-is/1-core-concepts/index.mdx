## Pipeline 

A pipeline receives records from one or multiple source connectors, pushes them through zero 
or multiple processors until they reach one or multiple destination connectors.

## Connector 

A connector is the internal entity that communicates with a connector plugin and either pushes 
records from the plugin into the pipeline (source connector) or the other way around 
(destination connector).

## Connector plugin 

Sometimes also referred to as "plugin", is an external process which communicates with Conduit 
and knows how to read/write records from/to a data source/destination (e.g. a database).

## Processor 

A component that executes an operation on a single record that flows through the pipeline. 
It can either change the record or filter it out based on some criteria.

## OpenCDC Record 

A record represents a single piece of data that flows through a pipeline (e.g. one database row). 
[More info here](/docs/using/opencdc-record).

## Collection 

A generic term used in Conduit to describe an entity in a 3rd party system from which records 
are read from or to which records they are written to. Examples are: topics (in Kafka), tables 
(in a database), indexes (in a search engine), collections (in NoSQL databases), etc.
