![Conduit Architecture](/img/conduit/conduit-architecture.svg)

Conduit is split into the following layers:

## API layer

Exposes the public APIs used to communicate with Conduit. It exposes 2 types of APIs:

### gRPC

This is the main API provided by Conduit. The gRPC API definition can be found in [api.proto](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/blob/main/proto/api/v1/api.proto), it can be used to generate code for the client.

### HTTP

The HTTP API is generated using [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway) and forwards the requests to the gRPC API. Conduit exposes an openapi definition that describes the HTTP API, which is also exposed through Swagger UI on `http://localhost:8080/openapi/`.

## Orchestration layer

The orchestration layer is responsible for coordinating the flow of operations between the core services. It also takes care of transactions, making sure that changes made to specific entities are not visible to the outside until the whole operation succeeded. There are five orchestrators, each responsible for actions related to one of the main entities:

- Pipeline Orchestrator.
- Connector Orchestrator.
- Processor Orchestrator.
- Connector Plugin Orchestrator.
- Processor Plugin Orchestrator.

## Core layer 

We regard the core to be the combination of the entity management layer and the pipeline engine. It provides functionality to the orchestrator layer and does not concern itself with where requests come from and how single operations are combined into more complex flows.

### Entity management

This layer is concerned with the creation, editing, deletion and storage of the main
entities. You can think about this as a simple CRUD layer. It can be split up further using the main entities:

#### Pipeline

This is the central entity managed by the Pipeline Service that ties together all other components.
A pipeline contains the configuration that defines how pipeline nodes should be connected together in a running
pipeline. It has references to at least one source and one destination connector and zero or multiple processors,
a pipeline that does not meet the criteria is regarded as incomplete and can't be started. A pipeline can be
either running, stopped or degraded (stopped because of an error). The pipeline can only be edited if it's not in
a running state.

#### Connector

A connector takes care of receiving or forwarding records to connector plugins, depending on its
type (source or destination). It is also responsible for tracking the connector state as records flow through it.
The Connector Service manages the creation of connectors and permanently stores them in the Connector Store. A
connector can be configured to reference a number of processors, which will be executed only on records that are
received from or forwarded to that specific connector.
* **Connector Plugin** - interfaces with Conduit on one side, and with the standalone connector plugin on the
other and facilitates the communication between them. A standalone connector plugin is a separate process that
implements the interface defined in
[conduit-connector-protocol](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-protocol) and provides the read/write
functionality for a specific resource (e.g. a database).
  
#### Processor

Processors are stateless components that operate on a single record and can execute arbitrary
  actions before forwarding the record to the next node in the pipeline. A processor can also choose to drop a
  record without forwarding it. They can be attached either to a connector or to a pipeline, based on that they are
  either processing only records that flow from/to a connector or all records that flow through a pipeline.
  * **Processor Plugin** - interfaces with Conduit on one side, and with the standalone processor plugin on the
  other and facilitates the communication between them. A standalone processor plugin is a WASM binary that
  implements the interface defined in
  [conduit-processor-sdk](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-processor-sdk) and provides the logic for processing
  a record (e.g. transforming its content).

### Pipeline Engine

The pipeline engine consists of nodes that can be connected together with Go channels to form a data pipeline.
  
#### Node

A node is a lightweight component that runs in its own goroutine and runs as long as the incoming channel
is open. As soon as the previous node stops forwarding records and closes its out channel, the current node also
stops running and closes its out channel. This continues down the pipeline until all records are drained and the
pipeline gracefully stops. In case a node experiences an error all other nodes will be notified and stop running
as soon as possible without draining the pipeline.

## Persistence layer

This layer is used directly by the [Orchestration layer](#orchestration-layer) and indirectly by the [Core layer](#core-layer), and [Schema registry service](#schema-registry-service) (through stores) to persist data. It provides the functionality of creating transactions and storing, retrieving and deleting arbitrary data like configurations or state. 

More information on [storage](/docs/features/storage).

## Connector utility services

### Schema registry service

The schema service is responsible for managing the schema of the records that flow through the pipeline. It provides functionality to infer a schema from a record. The schema is stored in the schema store and can be referenced by connectors and processors. By default, Conduit provides a built-in schema registry, but this service can be run separately from Conduit.
