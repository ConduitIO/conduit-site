## Our goal

In this guide, our goal will be to stream information about flights from an
imaginary airport to a file. The flight records contain just the airline name
and the scheduled departure time.

## Install Conduit

If you're using a macOS or Linux system, you can install Conduit with the
following command:

```shell
$ curl https://conduit.io/install.sh | bash
```

If you're not using macOS or Linux system, you can still install Conduit
following one of the different options provided
in [our installation page](/docs/installing-and-running).

:::note
The Conduit binary contains both, the Conduit service and the Conduit CLI, with
which you can interact with Conduit.

## Initialize Conduit 

Firs, let's initialize the working environment:

```shell
$ conduit init

Created directory: processors
Created directory: connectors
Created directory: pipelines
Configuration file written to conduit.yaml

Conduit has been initialized!

To quickly create an example pipeline, run 'conduit pipelines init'.
To see how you can customize your first pipeline, run 'conduit pipelines init --help'.
```

`conduit init` creates the directories where you can put your pipeline
configuration files, connector binaries, and processor binaries. There's also a
`conduit.yaml` that contains all the configuration parameters that Conduit
supports.

In this guide, we'll only use the `pipelines` directory, since we won't need to
install any additional connector nor to change Conduit's default configuration.

## Build a pipeline

Next, we can use the Conduit CLI to build the example pipeline:

```shell
$ conduit pipelines init
```

`conduit pipelines init` builds an example that generates flight information
from an imaginary airport every second. Use `conduit pipelines init --help` to
learn how to customize the pipeline.

If the `pipelines` directory, you'll notice a new file,
`pipeline-generator-to-file.yaml` that contains our pipeline's configuration:

```yaml
version: "2.2"
pipelines:
  - id: example-pipeline
    status: running
    name: "generator-to-file"
    connectors:
      - id: example-source
        type: source
        plugin: "generator"
        settings:
          # Generate field 'airline' of type string
          # Type: string
          # Optional
          format.options.airline: 'string'
          # Generate field 'scheduledDeparture' of type 'time'
          # Type: string
          # Optional
          format.options.scheduledDeparture: 'time'
          # The format of the generated payload data (raw, structured, file).
          # Type: string
          # Optional
          format.type: 'structured'
          # The maximum rate in records per second, at which records are
          # generated (0 means no rate limit).
          # Type: float
          # Optional
          rate: '1'
      - id: example-destination
        type: destination
        plugin: "file"
        settings:
          # Path is the file path used by the connector to read/write records.
          # Type: string
          # Optional
          path: './destination.txt'
```

The configuration above tells us some basic information about the pipeline (ID
and name) and that we want Conduit to start the pipeline automatically (
`status: running`).

Then we see a source connector, that uses the [
`generator` plugin](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-generator),
which is a built-in plugin that can generate random data. The source connector's
settings translate into: generate structured data, 1 record per second. Each
generated record should contain an `airline` field (type: string) and a
`scheduledDeparture` field (type: duration).

What follows is a destination connector where the data will be written to. It
uses the `file` plugin, which is a built-in plugin that writes all the incoming
data to a file. It has only one configuration parameter, which is the path to
the file where the records will be written.
 
## Run Conduit

With the pipeline configuration being ready, we can run Conduit:

```shell
$ conduit run --pipelines.path pipelines/
```

Conduit is now running the pipeline. Let's check the contents of the `destination.txt` using:

```shell
tail -f destination.txt | jq
```

Every second, you should a JSON object like this:

```shell
{
  "position": "MjU=",
  "operation": "create",
  "metadata": {
    "conduit.source.connector.id": "example-pipeline:example-source",
    "opencdc.createdAt": "1730801194148460912",
    "opencdc.payload.schema.subject": "example-pipeline:example-source:payload",
    "opencdc.payload.schema.version": "1"
  },
  "key": "cHJlY2VwdG9yYWw=",
  "payload": {
    "before": null,
    "after": {
      "airline": "wheelmaker",
      "scheduledDeparture": "2024-11-05T10:06:34.148469Z"
    }
  }
}
```

The JSON object you see is the [OpenCDC record](/docs/using/opencdc-record) that
holds the data being streamed as well as other data and metadata. In the
`.payload.after` field you will see the user data that was generated by the
`generator` connector:

```json
{
    "airline": "wheelmaker",
    "scheduledDeparture": "2024-11-05T10:06:34.148469Z"
}
```

The pipeline will keep streaming the data from the generator source connector to
the file destination connector as long as Conduit is running. To stop Conduit,
press `Ctrl + C` (on a Linux OS, or the equivalent on other operating systems). This will
trigger a graceful shutdown that stops reads from source connectors and waits
for records that are still in the pipeline to be acknowledged. The next time
Conduit starts, it will start reading data from where it stopped.

## What's next?

Now that you've got the basics of running Conduit and creating a pipeline
covered, here are a few places to dive in deeper:
- [Connectors](/docs/using/connectors/getting-started)
- [Pipelines](/docs/using/pipelines/configuration-file)
- [Processors](/docs/using/processors/getting-started)
