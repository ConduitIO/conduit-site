Conduit is a data streaming tool for software and data engineers, powered
by [Meroxa](https://meroxa.io). Its purpose is to help you move data from A to
B. You can use Conduit to send data from Kafka to Postgres, between files and
APIs, between [supported connectors](/docs/using/connectors/list),
and [any datastore you can build a plugin for](/docs/developing/connectors/).

It's written in [Go](https://go.dev/), compiles to a single binary, and is
designed to be easy to use and [deploy](/docs/installing-and-running).

Out of the box, Conduit comes with:

- Built-in connectors 
- Processors
- Observability
- Schema Support

## Features

Conduit comes with many powerful features such as:

* **Simple deployments**: Conduit is distributed as a single binary and doesn't
  require any external dependencies to run. We also provide a [Kubernetes
  operator](/docs/scaling/conduit-operator).
* **Real time by default**: Conduit pipelines continuously listen for changes to
  a database, data warehouse, etc., and allows your data applications to act
  upon those changes in real time.
* **Easily extensible**: Conduit connectors are plugins that communicate with Conduit
  via a gRPC interface. This means that plugins can be written in any language
  as long as they conform to the required interface. Check out
  our [connector docs](/docs/using/connectors/getting-started)!

The full list of features can be found on
the [Features](/docs/using/other-features) page.

Now let's [get started](/docs/getting-started) with our first pipeline!
