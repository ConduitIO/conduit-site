title: "Developing a Source Connector"
---

A Source is responsible for continuously reading data from a third party system
and returning it in the form of
an [OpenCDC Record](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-commons/opencdc#Record).

You need to implement the functions required by
the [Source](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Source)
interface and provide your own implementations. Information about individual
functions are listed below. The **`source.go`** file is the main file where the
functionality of your source connector is implemented.

## `Source struct`

Every Source implementation needs to include
an [UnimplementedSource](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#UnimplementedSource)
to satisfy the interface. This allows us to potentially change the interface in
the future while remaining backward compatible with existing Source
implementations. This struct can be modified to add additional fields that can
be accessed throughout the lifecycle of the Connector.

```go
type Source struct {
    sdk.UnimplementedSource

    config SourceConfig
    tail   *tail.Tail
}
```

## Source Connector Lifecycle Functions

### `NewSource()`

A constructor function for your Source struct. Note that this is the same
function that should be set as the value of `Connector.NewSource`. The
constructor should be used to wrap your Source with the SDK source middleware.
The middleware is configured through the source's configuration and is explained
in the following section.

```go
func NewSource() sdk.Source {
    // Create Source and wrap it in the default middleware.
	return sdk.SourceWithMiddleware(&Source{})
}
```

### `Config()`

The `Config()` function needs to return a pointer to the connector's active
configuration:

```go
func (s *Source) Config() sdk.SourceConfig {
	return &s.config
}
```

The SDK will parse the configuration map provided by a user (e.g. though a
pipeline configuration file), validate it, and, if the configuration is valid,
set the values into the value returned by `Config()`.

More information about configuration structs can be found
in [Connector Configuration](/docs/developing/connectors/connector-configuration).

### `Open()`

Prepares the connector to start producing records based on the last known
successful position. If needed, the connector should open connections in this
function.

Every record read by a source connector has
a [position](https://conduit.io/docs/using/opencdc-record#fields) attached.
The position given to `Open()` is the position of the record that was the last
to be successfully processed end-to-end, before the connector stopped, or `nil`
if no records were read. Hence, a position needs to contain enough information
for a source connector to resume reading records from where it exactly stopped.

A position is a slice of bytes that can represent any data structure. In Conduit
connectors, it's common to see that a position is actually a `struct`, that's
marshalled into a JSON string. In the example below, the position is an offset
within the file being read.

```go
func (s *Source) Open(ctx context.Context, p opencdc.Position) error {
    // parse the position
    var offset int64
    if p != nil {
        var err error
        offset, err = strconv.ParseInt(string(p), 10, 64)
        if err != nil {
            return fmt.Errorf("invalid position %v, expected a number", p)
        }
    }

    // seek to the position, i.e. the offset
    sdk.Logger(ctx).Info().
        Int64("position", offset).
        Msgf("seeking...")

    t, err := tail.TailFile(
        s.config.Path,
        tail.Config{
            Follow: true,
            Location: &tail.SeekInfo{
                Offset: offset,
                Whence: io.SeekStart,
            },
            Logger: tail.DiscardingLogger,
        },
    )
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("could not tail file: %w", err)
    }

    s.tail = t
    return nil
}
```

### `Read()`

Gathers data from the configured data source and formats it into a
`opencdc.Record` that is returned from the function. The returned
`opencdc.Record` is queued into the pipeline to be consumed by a Destination
connector.

```go
func (s *Source) Read(ctx context.Context) (opencdc.Record, error) {
    select {
    case line, ok := <-s.tail.Lines:
        if !ok {
            return opencdc.Record{}, s.tail.Err()
        }
        return sdk.Util.Source.NewRecordCreate(
            opencdc.Position(strconv.FormatInt(line.SeekInfo.Offset, 10)),
            map[string]string{
                MetadataFilePath: s.config.Path,
            },
            opencdc.RawData(strconv.Itoa(line.Num)), // use line number as key
            opencdc.RawData(line.Text),              // use line content as payload
        ), nil
    case <-ctx.Done():
        return opencdc.Record{}, ctx.Err()
    }
}
```

### `Ack()`

`Ack` signals to the third party system that the record with the supplied
position was successfully processed. It's worth noting that while some source
connectors need to implement this functionality (e.g. in the case of messaging
brokers), others don't have to (e.g. a file source).

```go
func (s *Source) Ack(ctx context.Context, position opencdc.Position) error {
    sdk.Logger(ctx).Trace().Msg("record successfully processed")
    return nil // no ack needed
}
```

### `Teardown()`

Teardown signals to the connector that there will be no more calls to any other
function. Any connections that were created in the `Open()` function should be
closed here.

```go
func (s *Source) Teardown(context.Context) error {
    if s.tail != nil {
        return s.tail.Stop()
    }
    return nil
}
```

## Schema

By default, the [sdk source middleware](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#SourceWithSchemaExtraction)
will dynamically generate a schema for each record. While convenient, this is
quite slow, as the middleware will try to create a schema for every single
record.

If the source connector is reading unstructured data, or you want to use your own
schema extraction logic, you can disable the middleware like this, as mentioned
before:

```go
func NewSource() sdk.Source {
	return sdk.SourceWithMiddleware(
		&Source{},
		sdk.DefaultSourceMiddleware(
			sdk.SourceWithSchemaExtractionConfig{
				PayloadEnabled: lang.Ptr(false),
				KeyEnabled:     lang.Ptr(false),
			},
		)...,
	)
}
```

Otherwise you can use [schema.Create](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk@v0.12.0/schema#Create)
to manually handle the schema creation:

```go
	import (
		"github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk/schema"
	    "github.com/conduitio/conduit-commons/schema/avro"
		hambaavro "github.com/hamba/avro/v2"
	)

	// create a user schema with name string and age int

	recordSchema, err := avro.NewBuilder("users", "example_namespace").
		AddField("name", hambaavro.NewPrimitiveSchema(hambaavro.String, nil)).
		AddField("age", hambaavro.NewPrimitiveSchema(hambaavro.Int, nil)).
		Build()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	s, err := schema.Create(ctx, schema.TypeAvro, "users", []byte(recordSchema.String()))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
```

An example implementation can be found in the [postgres connector](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-postgres).
