title: "Connector Specification"
---

A connector's specification is used to present information about the connector
and validate connector parameters. The specification can be found in the
`connectors.yaml` file, that's found in the root of a connector's repository.
The following is an example of
the [file connector's](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-file)
`connector.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
specification:
  name: file
  summary: A file source and destination plugin for Conduit.
  description: |-
    The file source allows you to listen to a local file and
    detect any changes happening to it. Each change will create a new record. The
    destination allows you to write record payloads to a destination file, each new
    record payload is appended to the file in a new line.
  version: v0.10.0
  author: Meroxa, Inc.
  source:
    parameters:
      - name: path
        description: Path is the file path used by the connector to read/write records.
        type: string
        default: ""
        validations:
          - type: required
            value: ""
    # other parameters
```

The contents of this file are embedded into a connector's binary and read by the
connector binary itself. `connector.yaml` is also being used by other tools that
enrich Conduit's functionality, such as the CLI, the documentation website, etc.

## Contents of `connector.yaml`

A part of `connector.yaml` is written by a developer (manually) and the other
part is generated by a tool that Conduit provides, [
`specgen`](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-sdk/tree/main/specgen).

A developer is writing the general information about the connector, which can be
seen in this part from the example above:

```yaml
specification:
  name: file
  summary: A file source and destination plugin for Conduit.
  description: |-
    The file source allows you to listen to a local file and
    detect any changes happening to it. Each change will create a new record. The
    destination allows you to write record payloads to a destination file, each new
    record payload is appended to the file in a new line.
  version: v0.10.0
  author: Meroxa, Inc.
```

Additional information may be added outside the `specification` key, for
example:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
specification:
  # specification section
# developer-info is just an example, any key can be used
developer-info:
  email: contact@example.com
  website: https://example.com
```

The information about a connector's source and destination parameters is
generated using a tool called [
`specgen`](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-sdk/tree/main/specgen).
`specgen` uses the configuration structs in a connector's code to generate the
list of parameters, the validations for those, etc. `specgen` is described in
more details in the following section.

## `specgen`

`specgen` works by inspecting the configuration structs that the source and
destination connectors return in the `Config()` method. Those configuration
structs will be transformed into a map of parameter descriptions that's written
into `connector.yaml`. More information about source and destination
configuration can be found
in [Developing a Source Connector](/docs/developing/connectors/developing-source-connectors)
and [Developing a Destination Connector](/docs/developing/connectors/developing-destination-connectors).

If you're using
the [Conduit Connector Template](/docs/developing/connectors/conduit-connector-template),
then the `specgen` tool is already listed in `tools.go` and can be installed
with `make install-tools`.

`specgen` is run as part of `go generate`. It also needs access to the
`sdk.Connector` variable that holds references to the constructor functions for the
source and the destination, so it's best to place it in the `connector.go` file.
The following is an example from the Kafka connector:

```go
//go:generate specgen

// Package kafka contains implementations for Kafka source and destination
// connectors for Conduit.
package kafka

import (
	_ "embed"

	sdk "github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk"
)

//go:embed connector.yaml
var specs string

var Connector = sdk.Connector{
	NewSpecification: sdk.YAMLSpecification(specs),
	NewSource:        NewSource,
	NewDestination:   NewDestination,
}
```

If you run `go generate ./...` or just use `make generate` (that's provided by
the connector template), you'll see that the `connector.yaml` is updated with
the source and/or destination parameters.

## Default values

Default values are taken from the following sources (higher to lower precedence):

1. a source or destination connector's configuration (returned by a connector's
   `Config()` method)
2. The `default` tag on fields in a configuration struct.

For example:

```go
type SourceConfig struct {
	URL string `default:"http://localhost:8080"`
}

func NewSource() sdk.Source {
    return sdk.SourceWithMiddleware(&Source{
        config: source.Config{
			URL: "https://example.com"
        },
    })
}
```

In this example, the default value in the generated specification will be
`"https://example.com"`, i.e. if a user doesn't specify a URL, its value will be
`"https://example.com"`.
