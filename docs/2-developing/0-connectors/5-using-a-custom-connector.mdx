## Adding the Connector to Conduit

The Conduit Connector template includes a `Makefile` that can be used to build a
binary version of your connector.

```bash
make build
```

After the command runs you should see a binary file with the name of the
connector in the local directory.

To run the Connector, you will need to move it to a directory that Conduit can
access. By default, this directory is the `connectors` directory located
alongside the Conduit binary. Move your newly created Connector binary into the
`connectors` directory and run Conduit using the following command:

```bash
./conduit
```

You can use Conduit's HTTP API to list the available connector plugins:

```shell
curl localhost:8080/v1/connectors/plugins
```

The response will list the found connector plugins and will display their
specifications. If you're looking just for the names, you can execute this
command:

```shell
curl localhost:8080/v1/connectors/plugins | jq '.[].name'
```

Alternatively, navigate to the
Conduit's [Swagger UI page](http://localhost:8080/openapi/#/ConnectorService/ConnectorService_ListConnectorPlugins) (
while Conduit is running) to see your Connector in the list of available
Connectors. You can filter plugins by regex to find your connector easier (e.g.
`.*standalone.*`, will give you all standalone connectors, because the
`standalone` prefix is added to all custom connectors).

## Using the Connector in a Conduit Pipeline

The recommended way to use the Connector is to define
a [pipeline configuration file](/docs/using/pipelines/configuration-file).
Alternatively, the HTTP API can be used.

When using custom Connectors in a pipeline configuration, they are prefixed with
phrase `standalone` unlike built in Connectors which are prefixed with
`builtin`. For example, to use a custom Connector named `file-sync` it would
look as follows:
`plugin: standalone:file-sync@[replace-with-connector-version]`.

More information about referencing connectors can be
found [here](/docs/using/connectors/referencing).

Below is an example of using a custom Connector in a pipeline configuration file:

``` yaml title="pipelines/use-custom-connector.yml"
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: use-custom-connector
    # run pipeline on startup
    status: running
    description: >
      Example pipeline reading to use a custom file sync connector.

    connectors:
      - id: source-sync
        type: source
        # use the custom file-sync plugin as the source
        plugin: standalone:file-sync@v0.1.0
        settings:
          # use ./data as the directory input to the file-sync connector; the connnector will watch for new files in this directory
          directory: ./data

      - id: destination-sync
        type: destination
        # use the custom file-sync plugin as the destination
        plugin: standalone:file-sync@v0.1.0
        settings:
        # use ./new_destination as the directory input to the file-sync connector; the connnector will write files from the pipeline to this directory
          directory: ./new_destination
```
