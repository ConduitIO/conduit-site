title: "Connector Lifecycle"
---

:::info
This document describes the lifecycle of a connector implemented in Go using the
[Connector SDK](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-sdk), which
abstracts away some parts of the Connector Protocol. If you are implementing a
connector in a different language you should refer to the
[Connector Protocol](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-protocol).
:::

Connector plugins that are implemented using the
[Connector SDK](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-sdk) can
implement 2 interfaces: [`Source`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Source)
for source connectors and [`Destination`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Destination)
for destination connectors. Below we will describe the order of the method calls
in sources and destinations, as well as when lifecycle events are triggered. For
more information on how to implement a connector see the
[Connector SDK godocs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk),
the [Connector Template](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-template)
or the [guide for building a connector](/docs/developing/connectors/).

## Lifecycle

The lifecycle of the connector generally looks like this:

1. The [connector plugin is loaded](#connector-plugin-is-loaded)
2. The user [creates the connector](#connector-is-created)
3. The user [starts and stops the pipeline](#pipeline-is-started-and-stopped)
4. The user [deletes the connector](#connector-is-deleted)

### Connector plugin is loaded

Conduit loads all connector plugins it discovers in the
[connector path](/docs/connectors/installing#installing-a-connector-in-conduit)
while starting up. Each plugin is started in a separate process to ensure it is
a valid binary and to obtain the connector specifications. These specifications
are then stored in Conduit's memory and exposed through the API. This helps the
UI display the available connector plugins and their corresponding parameters
that can be configured.

During the loading of connector specifications, the
[`Source.Parameters`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Source)
and
[`Destination.Parameters`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Destination)
methods are invoked to retrieve the parameters. These methods are called only
once, and no other methods are triggered before the connector process is
stopped.

### Connector is created

Upon creating a connector ([`POST /v1/connectors`](/api#post-/v1/connectors)),
Conduit validates the connector configuration. It starts an instance of the
connector plugin and invokes the `Configure` method to validate the
configuration. If the method returns no errors, the configuration is deemed
valid and the connector creation process continues, otherwise, the creation of
the connector is aborted. After that Conduit signals the plugin to stop by
invoking the `Teardown` method.

It's worth noting that the methods mentioned above are called either on
[`Source`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Source)
or [`Destination`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Destination),
depending on the type of the connector.

### Pipeline is started and stopped

Starting ([`POST /v1/pipelines/{id}/start`](/api#post-/v1/pipelines/-id-/start))
and stopping ([`POST /v1/pipelines/{id}/stop`](/api#post-/v1/pipelines/-id-/stop))
a pipeline triggers the start and stop of all connectors on that pipeline. This
means that a connector plugin process is started for each connector, and it is
kept running until the pipeline is stopped.

When the connector plugin starts, Conduit calls its methods in a specific order.
Note that the methods mentioned here are called either on
[`Source`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Source)
or [`Destination`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Destination),
depending on the type of the connector.

- `Configure` is first called to validate and store the connector configuration.
- Then Conduit triggers any applicable lifecycle events, specifically
  [`LifecycleOnCreated`](#on-created) or
  [`LifecycleOnUpdated`](#on-updated). See
  [lifecycle events](#lifecycle-events) for more detailed information on when
  each event is triggered.
- `Open` is called to allow the connector to prepare for reading or writing
  records (e.g. open connections).
- At this point the called methods depend on the type of the connector:
  - For a [`Source`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Source),
    Conduit will start continuously calling `Read` to fetch new records and
    `Ack` to signal acknowledgments for successfully processed records.
  - For a [`Destination`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Destination),
    Conduit will continuously call `Write` with records that should be written
    to the destination resource.

When the pipeline is stopped and Conduit stops reading/writing records, the last
method called is `Teardown`. This signals that the connector plugin process will
be terminated and provides a chance to clean up any open resources (e.g. close
connections).

### Connector is deleted

When a user deletes a connector ([`DELETE /v1/connectors/{id}`](/api#delete-/v1/connectors/-id-)),
Conduit starts the connector plugin and triggers the [On Deleted](#on-deleted)
event. After that it calls `Teardown` and stops the connector plugin process.

The specific methods called depend on whether the connector is a
[`Source`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Source)
or [`Destination`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Destination).

## Lifecycle Events

Connector Lifecycle Events are additional integration points that let connector
plugins execute certain operations when the connector is created, updated, or
deleted.

These events are useful for connectors that need to initialize resources only
once in their lifecycle and clean them up when the connector is deleted. For
example, the Postgres connector needs to create a logical replication slot when
the pipeline is started for the first time. This slot should persist between
pipeline restarts but should be deleted when the pipeline is deleted. Lifecycle
events can be used to implement this behavior.

The methods mentioned below are called either on
[`Source`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Source)
or [`Destination`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-sdk#Destination),
depending on the type of the connector.

### On Created

When this event is triggered, Conduit invokes the method `LifecycleOnCreated`.
This method can be used to perform initialization tasks that only need to happen
once in the lifetime of a connector, such as creating a bucket or preparing a
replication slot. Any resources created during this method are owned by the
connector and should be cleaned up during the [On Deleted](#on-deleted)
lifecycle event.

The On Created event is triggered the first time the pipeline is started after
the connector is created. The connector is considered "successfully started"
only after this event is successfully triggered (i.e. `LifecycleOnCreated`
returns no error). After that, the On Created event won't be triggered again,
and instead, [On Updated](#on-updated) or [On Deleted](#on-deleted) events will
be triggered when applicable.

Edge cases explained:

- If a connector is created and deleted without being started in between, the
  event won't be triggered.
- If a connector is created and updated without being started in between, the
  On Created event will be triggered at the next start with the latest
  configuration.

### On Updated

When this event is triggered, Conduit calls the method `LifecycleOnUpdated`.
This method can be used to update anything that was initialized in
[On Created](#on-created), in case the configuration change affects it.

This event is triggered the first time the pipeline is started after the
connector plugin configuration was updated, provided that the connector was
started at least once before and has already received the
[On Created](#on-created) event. The event will only be triggered if the
connector plugin configuration is different than the last time the connector was
started.

Edge cases explained:

- If a connector is created and updated without being started in between, the
  On Updated event will _not_ be triggered. Instead it will trigger the
  [On Created](#on-created) event.
- If the connector plugin configuration is updated multiple times, and the
  connector ends up with the same configuration as the last time it was started,
  then no lifecycle event will be triggered.
- If the connector plugin configuration is updated and changed multiple times,
  the On Updated event will be triggered only with the newest configuration.

### On Deleted

When this event is triggered, Conduit calls the method `LifecycleOnDeleted`.
This method can be used to perform cleanup operations for any resources that
were initialized during the [On Created](#on-created) event.

The On Deleted event is triggered when the connector gets deleted
([`DELETE /v1/connectors/{id}`](/api#delete-/v1/connectors/-id-)), but only if
the connector was previously started and received the [On Created](#on-created)
event.

Edge cases explained:

- If a connector is created and deleted without ever being started, the event
  won't be triggered.
- If a connector is updated and deleted without being started in between, the
  On Deleted event will receive the configuration that was active the last time
  the connector successfully started.
