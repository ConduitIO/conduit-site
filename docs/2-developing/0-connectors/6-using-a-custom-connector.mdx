title: "Using a Custom Connector in Conduit"

## Building your custom connector

The [Conduit Connector template](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-template) 
includes a `Makefile` that can be used to build a binary version of your connector. 

For the purpose of this guide, we're going to use our [Conduit Snowflake Connector as an example](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-snowflake). You can imagine it as if you were adding your custom connector for the first time. 

From your standalone connector directory, run:

```shell title="/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-snowflake"
make build
```

## Adding the Connector to Conduit

After the command runs you should see a binary file with the name of the
connector in the local directory. 

To run the connector, you will need to move it to a directory that Conduit can
access. By default, this directory is the `connectors` directory located
alongside the Conduit binary. Move your newly created Connector binary into the
`connectors` directory.

```shell title="/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-snowflake"
mv conduit-connector-snowflake /conduitio/conduit/connectors
```

## Checking your Connector is available in Conduit

Conduit using the following command:

```shell title="/conduitio/conduit"
./conduit run
```

Once moved, you should be able to see your custom Connector as a registered connector plugin. Using our [Conduit Snowflake Connector as an example](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-snowflake), by using our [Conduit CLI](/docs/cli) in a different terminal session, you should see the Snowflake Connector listed as a plugin.


### Using the Conduit CLI

```shell title="/conduitio/conduit"
./conduit connector-plugins list
+-----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  NAME                   |                               SUMMARY                                |
+-----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| builtin:file@v0.10.0                    | A file source and destination plugin for Conduit.                    |
| builtin:generator@v0.10.0               | A plugin capable of generating dummy records (in different formats). |
| builtin:kafka@v0.12.0                   | A Kafka source and destination plugin for Conduit, written in Go.    |
| builtin:log@v0.7.0                      | A destination connector that logs all incoming records.              |
| builtin:postgres@v0.11.0                | Conduit connector for PostgreSQL                                     |
| builtin:s3@v0.9.0                       | An S3 source and destination plugin for Conduit, written in Go.      |
| standalone:snowflake@v0.3.1-11-g1dc4b8d | An Snowflake source plugin for Conduit, written in Go.               |
+-----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Using the Conduit HTTP API

```shell
curl localhost:8080/v1/connectors/plugins
```

The response will list the found connector plugins and will display their
specifications. If you're looking just for the names, you can execute this
command:

```shell
curl localhost:8080/v1/connectors/plugins | jq '.[].name'
```

Alternatively, navigate to the
Conduit's [Swagger UI page](http://localhost:8080/openapi/#/ConnectorService/ConnectorService_ListConnectorPlugins) (
while Conduit is running) to see your Connector in the list of available
Connectors. You can filter plugins by regex to find your connector easier (e.g.
`.*standalone.*`, will give you all standalone connectors, because the
`standalone` prefix is added to all custom connectors).

## Using the Connector in a Conduit Pipeline

The recommended way to use the Connector is to define
a [pipeline configuration file](/docs/using/pipelines/configuration-file).
Alternatively, the HTTP API can be used.

When using custom Connectors in a pipeline configuration, they are prefixed with
phrase `standalone` unlike built in Connectors which are prefixed with
`builtin`. Continuing with our [Conduit Snowflake Connector](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-snowflake) as an example, it would
look as follows: `plugin: standalone:snowflake@v0.3.1-11-g1dc4b8d`.

More information about referencing connectors can be
found [here](/docs/using/connectors/referencing).

Below is an example of using this same Conduit Snowflake Connector in a [pipeline configuration file](/docs/using/pipelines/configuration-file):

``` yaml title="pipelines/use-custom-connector.yml"
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: use-snowflake-connector
    # run pipeline on startup
    status: running
    description: >
      Example pipeline reading from Postgres to Snowflake.

    connectors:
      - id: source-postgres
        type: source
        plugin: builtin:postgres
        settings:
          url: "postgres://exampleuser:examplepass@localhost:5433/exampledb?sslmode=disable"
          tables: "users"
          cdcMode: "logrepl"
          logrepl.publicationName: "examplepub"
          logrepl.slotName": "exampleslot"

      - id: destination-snowflake
        type: destination
        # use the snowflake plugin as the destination
        plugin: standalone:snowflake@v0.3.1-11-g1dc4b8d
        settings:
          snowflake.url: "snowflake://exampleuser:examplepass@localhost:5433/exampledb?sslmode=disable"
          snowflake.username: "exampleuser"
          snowflake.table: "users"
          snowflake.orderingColumn: "id"
```

## Next steps

Once you're able to run and test your custom connector as a [standalone connector](/docs/core-concepts#standalone-connector), we highly recommend you to include it to Conduit as a [builtin connector](/docs/core-concepts#built-in-connector) to increase its performance.

You can check out this separate page on [how to do it](/docs/using/connectors/additional-built-in-plugins).


If your connector is ready to be shared with the community, join our [Discord Community](https://discord.meroxa.com/) and let us know so it can be featured in our [ConduitIO Labs GitHub organization](https://github.com/conduitio-labs) or simply to make sure it's listed on our [Connectors List](/docs/using/connectors/list/).
