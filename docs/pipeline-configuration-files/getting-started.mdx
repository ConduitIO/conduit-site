Pipeline configuration files give you the ability to define pipelines that are
provisioned by Conduit at startup. It's as simple as creating a YAML file that
defines pipelines, connectors, processors, and their corresponding
configurations.

When you [install](/docs/#installing) Conduit, you'll find a `pipelines` directory at the same level as your Conduit binary. This is where all your pipeline configuration files will be located **by default**:

```shell
│ # Conduit binary
├── conduit
│ # Folder with pipeline configurations
└── pipelines
    │ # Pipeline configuration file
    └── source-to-destination.yml
```

:::tip

You can also specify a different path for the pipeline configurations directory using the `-p` flag when starting Conduit:

```shell
./conduit run -p /path/to/pipelines
```

To help you get started, we've created a pipeline configuration generator that will help you create your pipeline configuration file. Take the next steps to generate your first pipeline configuration file. Check out the different [specifications](/docs/pipeline-configuration-files/specifications) to learn more about the different configuration options.

<PipelineConfigGenerator />

```shell
$ ./conduit
/.../
2023-04-01T12:34:56+00:00 INF pipeline configs provisioned component=provisioning.Service created=["file-to-file"] deleted=[] pipelines_path=./pipelines
/.../
```

Conduit is now running the pipeline `file-to-file` which continuously reads
lines added to file `./example.in` and copies them to file `./example.out`. Try
writing a line to `./example.in` and checking the content of `./example.out`.

```shell
$ echo "hello conduit" >> example.in
$ cat example.out
hello conduit
```
