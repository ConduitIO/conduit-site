Pipeline configuration files give you the ability to define pipelines that are
provisioned by Conduit at startup. It's as simple as creating a YAML file that
defines pipelines, connectors, processors, and their corresponding
configurations.

## Example pipeline (file to file)

Create a folder called `pipelines` at the same level as your Conduit binary.
Inside of that folder create a file named `file-to-file.yml`.

```shell
│ # Conduit binary
├── conduit
│ # Folder with pipeline configurations
└── pipelines
    │ # Pipeline configuration file
    └── file-to-file.yml
```

Copy following content into `file-to-file.yml`:

``` yaml title="pipelines/file-to-file.yml"
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: file-to-file
    # run pipeline on startup
    status: running
    description: >
      Example pipeline reading from file "example.in" and writing into file "example.out".

    connectors:
      - id: example.in
        type: source
        # use the built-in file plugin as the source
        plugin: builtin:file
        settings:
          # read data from example.in
          path: ./example.in

      - id: example.out
        type: destination
        # use the built-in file plugin as the destination
        plugin: builtin:file
        settings:
          # write data to example.out
          path: ./example.out
          # output the raw payload as a string
          sdk.record.format: template
          sdk.record.format.options: '{{ printf "%s" .Payload.After }}'
```

Now start Conduit. You should see a log line saying that the pipeline
`file-to-file` was created:

```shell
$ ./conduit
/.../
2023-04-01T12:34:56+00:00 INF pipeline configs provisioned component=provisioning.Service created=["file-to-file"] deleted=[] pipelines_path=./pipelines
/.../
```

Conduit is now running the pipeline `file-to-file` which continuously reads
lines added to file `./example.in` and copies them to file `./example.out`. Try
writing a line to `./example.in` and checking the content of `./example.out`.

```shell
$ echo "hello conduit" >> example.in
$ cat example.out
hello conduit
```
