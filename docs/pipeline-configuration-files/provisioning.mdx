## Pipelines Directory

When Conduit starts, it will search for all files ending with `.yml` or `.yaml` in folder `./pipelines` and its
sub-folders. It will parse the configuration files and provision the pipelines defined in them.

If you want Conduit to search a different directory, or want to provision a single file, you can specify the CLI flag
`pipelines.path` and point to your file or directory:

```shell
./conduit -pipelines.path /path/to/my-directory
```

If the directory does not exist, Conduit will fail with the error `"pipelines.path" config value is invalid`.

## Ignored errors

Conduit will try to provision all pipelines regardless of the errors it may encounter while going through the
configuration files. Invalid configuration files will be ignored (e.g. files that miss a mandatory field or have an
invalid configuration value) and won't impact the provisioning of valid configuration files. Conduit will log a warning
for every error it encounters during this process.

You need to be careful when choosing IDs for your pipelines, connectors and processors. Each pipeline needs to get a
unique pipeline ID, otherwise all pipelines with the same ID will be ignored. If a pipeline contains connectors or
processors with the same ID, they will be ignored as well.

**_Note_**: Connector IDs and processor IDs will be prefixed with the parent ID. In case of a connector this means the
pipeline ID will be attached as a prefix to the connector ID (e.g. `pipelineID:connectorID`). Similarly, a pipeline
processor's ID will be prefixed with the pipeline ID (e.g. `pipelineID:processorID`) and a connector processor's ID will
be prefixed with the connector ID (e.g. `pipelineID:connectorID:processorID`). This ensures that connector and processor
IDs are globally unique as long as the pipeline ID is unique.

## Pipelines Immutability

Pipelines provisioned by configuration files are **immutable**, any updates needed on a provisioned pipeline have to be
done through the configuration file. You can still stop or start the pipeline through the UI or API.

### Updates and Deletes

Updates and deletes for a pipeline provisioned by configuration files can only be done through configuration files.
Changes should be made to the files, then Conduit has to be restarted to reload the changes. Any updates or deletes done
through the API or UI will be prohibited.

To delete a pipeline you need to remove the pipeline from the configuration file or delete the file entirely. Next time
Conduit starts it will delete the pipeline.

To update a pipeline you need to change any field value in the configuration file. Next time Conduit starts it will
update the pipeline to match the new configuration.

Updates will preserve the state of the pipeline, so it resumes processing at the last record that was successfully
processed. However, updates of some fields will cause the state to be lost, as it can't be guaranteed that the state is
still applicable to the new configuration. In that case the pipeline will start processing records from the beginning,
as if it's running for the first time. Here is a full list of fields that cause this behavior:
- [`pipeline.id`](/docs/pipeline-configuration-files/specifications#id)
- [`connector.id`](/docs/pipeline-configuration-files/specifications#id-1) (only for source connectors)
- [`connector.type`](/docs/pipeline-configuration-files/specifications#type) (only for source connectors)
- [`connector.plugin`](/docs/pipeline-configuration-files/specifications#plugin-1) (only for source connectors)
