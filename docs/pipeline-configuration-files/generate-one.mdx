Pipeline configuration files give you the ability to define pipelines that are
provisioned by Conduit at startup. It's as simple as creating a YAML file that
defines pipelines, connectors, processors, and their corresponding
configurations.

## Generate a pipeline configuration file

:::tip

In our [Conduit repository](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit), you can find [more examples](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/tree/main/examples/pipelines), but to help you get started pick and choose your desired pipeline configuration. Check out the different [specifications](/docs/pipeline-configuration-files/specifications) to learn more about the different configuration options.

:::

Create a folder called `pipelines` at the same level as your Conduit binary.
Inside of that folder create a file named `file-to-file.yml`.

```shell
│ # Conduit binary
├── conduit
│ # Folder with pipeline configurations
└── pipelines
    │ # Pipeline configuration file
    └── file-to-file.yml
```

Copy following content into `file-to-file.yml`:

<PipelineConfigGenerator />

Now start Conduit. You should see a log line saying that the pipeline
`file-to-file` was created:

```shell
$ ./conduit
/.../
2023-04-01T12:34:56+00:00 INF pipeline configs provisioned component=provisioning.Service created=["file-to-file"] deleted=[] pipelines_path=./pipelines
/.../
```

Conduit is now running the pipeline `file-to-file` which continuously reads
lines added to file `./example.in` and copies them to file `./example.out`. Try
writing a line to `./example.in` and checking the content of `./example.out`.

```shell
$ echo "hello conduit" >> example.in
$ cat example.out
hello conduit
```
