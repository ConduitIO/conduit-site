[Built-in connectors](/docs/core-concepts#built-in-connector) offer better performance when compared to [standalone](/docs/core-concepts#standalone-connector) ones,
which is why in some cases it's desirable to have a custom build of Conduit that
includes additional built-in connectors.

The simplest way to achieve so is to write a small application that embeds
Conduit (i.e. uses Conduit as a library) and adds one or more connectors to its
default configuration.

:::note
For the purpose of this example, we're going to add the [Conduit Snowflake connector](/docs/using/connectors/list/snowflake) to Conduit as a [built-in connector](/docs/core-concepts#built-in-connector), and we're going to name our application `custom-conduit-app` pushed to `github.com/conduitio-labs`.
:::

## Initialize your own Conduit Application

First we'll create the directory structure for our custom Conduit application and initialize a Go module:

```shell
mkdir -p custom-conduit-app && touch custom-conduit-app/main.go
cd custom-conduit-app
go mod init github.com/conduitio-labs/custom-conduit-app
```

## Add the connector as a built-in plugin

Once that is done, we need to write a `main` function that adds the Snowflake connector to the default Conduit configuration. Later we'll run Conduit with this custom configuration.


### Write the `main` function

```go title="custom-conduit-app/main.go"
package main

import (
	snowflake "github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-snowflake"
	"github.com/conduitio/conduit/cmd/conduit/cli"
	"github.com/conduitio/conduit/pkg/conduit"
)

func main() {
	// Get the default configuration, including all built-in connectors
	cfg := conduit.DefaultConfig()

	// Add the Snowflake connector to list of built-in connectors
	cfg.ConnectorPlugins["snowflake"] = snowflake.Connector

	cli.Run(cfg)
}
```

### Add your dependencies

```shell
go get github.com/conduitio/conduit
go get github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-snowflake
go mod tidy
```

### Build your application binary

This custom version of Conduit can be built with: 

```shell title="custom-conduit-app"
go build -o custom-conduit main.go
```

### Check the Snowflake connector is included

In order to interact with Conduit, you need to make sure you run the service first. 

:::important
By running the Conduit, you will also process any pipelines configured in the default configuration (`./custom-conduit-app/pipelines`).

Assuming you're only going through this guide, no pipelines have been configured yet, so no data would be processed.
:::

```shell title="custom-conduit-app"
./custom-conduit run
``` 

In a different terminal session, you can check that the Snowflake connector has been 
included in the build by listing all the connector plugins as built-in: 

#### Using the [Conduit CLI](/docs/cli)

```shell title="custom-conduit-app"
./custom-conduit connector-plugins list
+---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|           NAME            |                               SUMMARY                                |
+---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| builtin:file@v0.10.0      | A file source and destination plugin for Conduit.                    |
| builtin:generator@v0.10.0 | A plugin capable of generating dummy records (in different formats). |
| builtin:kafka@v0.12.0     | A Kafka source and destination plugin for Conduit, written in Go.    |
| builtin:log@v0.7.0        | A destination connector that logs all incoming records.              |
| builtin:postgres@v0.11.0  | Conduit connector for PostgreSQL                                     |
| builtin:s3@v0.9.0         | An S3 source and destination plugin for Conduit, written in Go.      |
| builtin:snowflake@v0.4.0  | An Snowflake source plugin for Conduit, written in Go.               |
+---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

#### Using the API

```shell
curl localhost:8080/v1/connectors/plugins | jq '.[].name'
"builtin:kafka@v0.12.0"
"builtin:log@v0.7.0"
"builtin:postgres@v0.11.0"
"builtin:s3@v0.9.0"
"builtin:snowflake@v.4.0"
"builtin:file@v0.10.0"
"builtin:generator@v0.10.0"
```

## Next steps

Once you have confirmed that your Conduit Connector is available in your application, you are ready to transfer any pipeline you had previously tested to the custom Conduit application:

```bash title="custom-conduit-app"
mkdir pipelines
mv $PREVIOUSLY_TESTED_CONDUIT/pipelines/* pipelines/
./custom-conduit run
```

Or configure it to read from the desired pipelines directory:

```bash title="custom-conduit-app"
./custom-conduit run --pipelines.path $YOUR_PIPELINES_DIRECTORY
```

:::note
If you, on the other hand, didn't have any pipeline previously configured and you'd like to get started, check out this page on [how to build a pipeline](/docs/getting-started#build-a-pipeline). Just remember that any `conduit` command from the terminal would need to be replaced by your custom conduit binary `./custom-conduit`.
