title: "Batching"
---

## Overview

Batching can significantly improve a pipeline's throughput, as it reduces the
number of round-trips between systems. In Conduit's context, it means that
source connectors can read batches of records and that destination records can
write batches of records. Here, processors act like map functions that are
applied to collections (i.e., batches).

:::note
While batching can improve the performance of a pipeline, it can also increase
the memory usage of the connector (as it needs to store multiple records in
memory before flushing the batch). It can also increase the latency of the
connector, as it needs to wait for the batch to be full.
:::

## Batching support in connectors

It should be noted that Conduit _facilitates_ batching and that the actual
implementation of batching is a connector's responsibility. For example, Conduit
can collect a batch of records and send it to a destination connector. Whether
the destination writes the records in a single request or not is a matter of its
implementation. 

Similarly, Conduit can request a batch of `N` records from a
source connector. The source connector might read `N` records in one request,
but it might also issue `N` read requests.

:::tip

Please consult a connector's documentation to find out if and how it supports
batching.

## Pipeline engines and batching

Batching can be effective regardless of the [pipeline architecture](/TBD) used,
because the optimization occurs in the connector itself. However, pipeline
architecture v2 takes better advantage of batching, since it's able to move the
whole batch, as a single unit, through the pipeline.

## Configuration

Batching can be configured in a source, destination, or both. Using batching in
both is discouraged and will be removed in a future release. This is due to
Conduit migrating to pipeline architecture v2.

:::note

By default, batching is disabled, i.e., Conduit reads and writes records one by
one.

:::

### `sdk.batch.size`

The maximum number of the records in a batch. A batch may contain fewer
records depending on how many records are available in a source system and on
the value of `sdk.batch.delay`.

**Default value**: `1`.

### `sdk.batch.delay`

This is the maximum time to wait for a batch to be full.

**Default value**: `0`.

:::important

Both parameters need to be set for batching to work correctly. If
`sdk.batch.size` is set, but `sdk.batch.delay` isn't, Conduit might wait for the
batch size to be reached either for a long time or indefinitely.

## Examples

### Example 1: Batch delay

The following pipeline is configured to collect records for 5 seconds before
flushing the batch to the destination resource. Note that the source connector
is generating records at a rate of 10 records per second, meaning that a batch
will contain approximately 50 records.

```yaml
version: 2.2

pipelines:
  - id: pipeline1
    status: running
    name: pipeline1
    description: 'A pipeline batching 100 records at a time.'
    connectors:
      - id: source1
        type: source
        plugin: builtin:generator
        name: source1
        settings:
          rate: 10
          operations: "create"
          format.type: "structured"
          format.options.name: "string"
          format.options.company: "string"
      - id: destination1
        type: destination
        plugin: "builtin:file"
        name: destination1
        settings:
          sdk.batch.delay: "5s"
          path: /tmp/file-destination.txt
```

### Example 2: Batch size and delay

The following pipeline is configured to collect batches of 100 records for up to
5 seconds before flushing them to the destination resource. This means that
records will be flushed at most every 5 seconds, or sooner if the batch collects
100 records.

```yaml
version: 2.2

pipelines:
  - id: pipeline1
    status: running
    name: pipeline1
    description: 'A pipeline batching 100 records at a time.'
    connectors:
      - id: source1
        type: source
        plugin: builtin:generator
        name: source1
        settings:
          rate: 10
          operations: "create"
          format.type: "structured"
          format.options.name: "string"
          format.options.company: "string"
      - id: destination1
        type: destination
        plugin: "builtin:file"
        name: destination1
        settings:
          sdk.batch.size: 100
          sdk.batch.delay: "5s"
          path: /tmp/file-destination.txt
```
