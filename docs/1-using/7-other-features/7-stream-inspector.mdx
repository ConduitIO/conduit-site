Conduit's stream inspector makes it possible to peek at the data as it enters
Conduit via source connectors and what the
data looks like as it travels to destination connectors. Keep in mind that this
feature is about sampling data as it
passes through the pipeline not tailing the pipeline.

Stream inspection doesn't affect a pipeline's performance. However, if the data
is being pushed through the stream very fast, it's possible that you may not see
all the records. This is done to protect Conduit's performance (by not keeping
too much data in the memory) and to protect the pipeline's performance (by not
blocking it until data is inspected).

The inspection will **not** be automatically stopped if the connector being
inspected is stopped. This makes it
possible to "catch" all the records, from the moment a connector starts. It also
makes it possible to inspect records
as you're potentially restarting a pipeline.

Stream inspection is available via Conduit's API.

## Stream inspection using Conduit's API

To access the stream inspector through the API, you'll need a WebSocket client (
for example [wscat](https://github.com/websockets/wscat)). The URL on which the
inspector is available comes in the following format:
`ws://host:port/v1/connectors/<connector ID>/inspect`. For example, if you run
Conduit locally with the default settings, you can inspect a connector by
running the following command:

```shell
$ wscat -c ws://localhost:8080/v1/connectors/pipeline1:destination1/inspect | jq .
{
  "result": {
    "position": "NGVmNTFhMzUtMzUwMi00M2VjLWE2YjEtMzdkMDllZjRlY2U1",
    "operation": "OPERATION_CREATE",
    "metadata": {
      "opencdc.readAt": "1669886131666337227"
    },
    "key": {
      "rawData": "NzQwYjUyYzQtOTNhOS00MTkzLTkzMmQtN2Q0OWI3NWY5YzQ3"
    },
    "payload": {
      "before": {
        "rawData": ""
      },
      "after": {
        "structuredData": {
          "company": "string 1d4398e3-21cf-41e0-9134-3fe012e6d1fb",
          "id": 1534737621,
          "name": "string fbc664fa-fdf2-4c5a-b656-d52cbddab671",
          "trial": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The above command also uses `jq` to pretty-print the output. You can also use
`jq` to decode Base64-encoded strings, which may represent record positions,
keys or payloads:

```shell
wscat -c ws://localhost:8080/v1/connectors/pipeline1:destination1/inspect | jq '.result.key.rawData |= @base64d'
```
