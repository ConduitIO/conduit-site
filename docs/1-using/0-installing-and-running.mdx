    The recommended way of running Conduit on a local machine is using the latest version which you can install by running the following command:
    
```
curl https://conduit.io/install.sh | bash
```

### Run

Once installed, you can start Conduit by running:

```shell
conduit
```

  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    Below we'll walk through getting Conduit installed and running on your Windows OS.

### Download

First, download
the [latest Conduit release](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/latest)
for your platform.

Let's say you downloaded `conduit_0.13.4_Windows_x86_64.zip`.

### Unzip the archive

```shell
tar -xf conduit_0.13.4_Windows_x86_64.zip
```

### Run

In the directory in which you expanded the archive. Execute the Conduit binary:

```shell
conduit.exe run
```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">
    We distribute [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) images to ease the use of Conduit in a containerized environment. To see details about how our images are built please feel free to take a look at the `Dockerfile` [here](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/blob/main/Dockerfile).
Conduit's Docker images are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/pkgs/container/conduit).

### Run

After you install Docker, you can pull the Conduit image by running the
following command:

```shell
docker pull conduit.docker.scarf.sh/conduitio/conduit
```
Then, you can run Conduit by running:

```shell
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 conduit.docker.scarf.sh/conduitio/conduit
```

The command aboves runs Conduit with no pipelines. To run Conduit with a custom
pipeline file you can mount it as a volume into the container:

```shell
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/pipeline.yaml:/app/pipelines/pipeline.yaml \
  conduit.docker.scarf.sh/conduitio/conduit
```

:::tip
If you're using Docker, check
out [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/). After we push an update,
Watchtower will keep your Conduit container updated by gracefully shutting down
your existing container and restarting it with the same options used when
initially deployed.

  <TabItem value="source" label="Building from source">
Before you can build Conduit from source, you need to have the latest version of Go installed. The Go website has [comprehensive instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install) on how to get the language installed on your machine. Once installed, you can follow the rest of the instructions.

1. Start by downloading the source code from the latest stable release on the Conduit [Releases Page](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/latest). Alternatively, you can run this command to automatically download the latest stable source to your current directory:

```shell
$ TAG=v0.13.4; curl -o conduit.tar.gz -L https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/archive/refs/tags/$TAG.tar.gz
```

A file called `conduit.tgz` will be in your current directory. The next step is to expand the source:

```shell
$ tar zxvf conduit.tgz
```

Then change directories to the appropriate folder. Keep in mind that the folder
name might be different between releases since it's tied to the latest git sha
for the commit.

```shell
$ cd conduit-0.13.4
```

Now build the project:

```shell
$ make
```

You will have a new binary built for your architecture and machine. All that's
left is to run it!

```shell
./conduit run
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should now be able to interact with Conduit through the CLI or its HTTP API
on port 8080:
