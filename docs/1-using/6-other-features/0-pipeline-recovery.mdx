title: 'Pipeline Recovery'
---

Pipeline Recovery is a feature in Conduit through which pipelines that
experience certain types of errors are automatically restarted. This document
describes how Pipeline Recovery in Conduit works and how it can be configured.

:::note

Pipeline Recovery is enabled by default since [Conduit v0.12](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/tag/v0.12.0). The feature can
be [disabled](#how-to-disable-pipeline-recovery) if needed.

## Introduction

Most pipeline errors encountered are a result of temporary issues like network
interruptions or services being unavailable due to maintenance. It then becomes
a matter of how we handle the pipeline.

In most cases, simply retrying is enough to get through transient errors
efficiently. This can and should be done by connectors and processors, but that
may not always be the case. For Conduit users, this typically means they would
need to wait for the connector or processor to be updated. This implies that we
need to have in Conduit an automatic mechanism for restarting pipelines that
experienced an error.

## What triggers pipeline recovery

Any _non-fatal_ error can trigger pipeline recovery. In the context of
pipelines, we differentiate between two types of errors: fatal and non-fatal.

**Fatal errors** are the errors that a pipeline cannot recover from. Two types
of errors are fatal by default:

1. [DLQ threshold](/docs/using/other-features/dead-letter-queue) exceeded (because the purpose of the DLQ threshold is to stop a
   pipeline if too many records are nack-ed)
2. Processor errors (because processors are usually deterministic, so if a
   processor failed processing a record once, it will most likely fail
   processing a record again)

:::info
In one of the next versions of Conduit and the Connector SDK, we'll make it
possible for connectors to define what errors they consider as fatal.

**Non-fatal errors** are all the other errors, i.e. errors for which it makes
sense to restart a pipeline and retry the data streaming.

## Algorithm

Pipeline Recovery restarts a pipeline using a linear backoff algorithm. One
important addition is that Conduit tracks the number of retries over a period of
time configured by the option `max-retries-window`. 

If `max-retries` has been set, then Conduit will
make sure that there are at most `max-retries` over **any** `max-retries-window`
period of time. In other words, the number of restart attempts is reset to 0
after `max-retries-window`.

This way, `max-retries-window` makes sure that we can safely reset the attempts
to 0 even in the following cases:

1. When a pipeline has been running long enough. For example, if a pipeline
   failed `max-retries - 1` times months ago, then it's unexpected that it fails
   now because of one failure.
2. When a pipeline is unstable and frequently failing. For example, a pipeline
   might experience an error and recover just before `max-retries` has been
   reached. It might run for some time more and then fail again. If we're not
   careful about resetting `max-retries`, then the pipeline might enter another
   recovery cycle very soon, which would be against what a user intended 
   (limiting the number of retries).

Here's a diagram of the algorithm:

## How to disable Pipeline Recovery

To disable Pipeline Recovery, you should set the configuration parameter
`pipelines.error-recovery.max-retries` to 0. With this, you'll have the
pre-v0.12 behavior, where a pipeline stops and goes into the `degraded` state
the first time it experiences an error.

## Configuration

### pipelines.error-recovery.min-delay

- **Data Type**: [Duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
- **Required**: No
- **Default**: 1s
- **Description**: Minimum delay before restarting the pipeline after an error.

### pipelines.error-recovery.max-delay

- **Data Type**: [Duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
- **Required**: No
- **Default**: 10m
- **Description**: Maximum delay allowed before restarting the pipeline after an
  error.

### pipelines.error-recovery.backoff-factor

- **Data Type**: Integer
- **Required**: No
- **Default**: 2
- **Description**: Backoff factor applied to the last delay when recovering from
  errors.

### pipelines.error-recovery.max-retries

- **Data Type**: Integer
- **Required**: No
- **Default**: -1
- **Description**: Maximum number of retry attempts before the pipeline gives
  up. A value of `-1` indicates infinite retries.


### pipelines.error-recovery.max-retries-window

- **Data Type**: [Duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
- **Required**: No
- **Default**: 5m
- **Description**: No more than `max-retries` are allowed within any
  `max-retries-window` period of time.

## Examples

### Example 1: Setting a custom `max-delay`

The `conduit.yaml` below shows how to set a custom maximum delay before a
pipeline is restarted. By default, `max-delay` is 10 minutes and here we're
setting it to 10 seconds.

```yaml
pipelines:
  error-recovery:
    max-delay: "10s"
```

If a pipeline experiences an error, the delays between restarts will be as follows:

* Attempt 1: 1s
* Attempt 2: 2s
* Attempt 3: 4s
* Attempt 4: 8s
* Attempt 5: 10s
* Attempt 6: 10s
* ...
* Attempt N: 10s

## Example 2: Setting a custom `max-retries` and `max-retries-window`

The `conduit.yaml` below shows how to limit the number of pipeline restarts to
3 (by default, the number of retries isn't limited). It also sets the
`max-retries-window` to 10 minutes (default value is 5 minutes).

```yaml
pipelines:
  error-recovery:
    max-retries: "2"
    max-retries-window: "10m"
```

Below, we'll explain different scenarios with failing pipelines using the same
Conduit configuration.

**Scenario 1: Maximum number of retries reached**

**15:00** Pipeline starts.
**15:10** Pipeline experiences an error (source system unavailable).
**15:10** Pipeline is restarted (retry #1).

**15:11** Pipeline experiences an error again.
**15:11** Pipeline is restarted (retry #2).

**15:15** Pipeline experiences an error again.
**15:15** Pipeline has been restarted 2 times (`max-retries`) over the last 10
minutes (`max-retries-window`). No more retries are allowed, hence the pipeline stops
and its status is set to `degraded`.

**Scenario 2: Number of retries reset after some time**

**15:00** Pipeline starts.

**15:10** Pipeline experiences an error (source system unavailable).
**15:10** Pipeline is restarted (retry #1).

**15:11** Pipeline experiences an error again.
**15:11** Pipeline is restarted (retry #2).

**15:20** Internally, Conduit increments the number of available retries by 1,
because 10 minutes (`max-retries-window`) since the first retry have passed.

**15:35** Pipeline experiences an error again.
**15:35** Pipeline is restarted because we didn't restart 2 times (`max-retries`) over the last 10
minutes (`max-retries-window`).
