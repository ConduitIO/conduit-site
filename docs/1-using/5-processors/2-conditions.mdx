title: 'Conditional Execution'
---

When a [processor](/docs/using/connectors/getting-started) is attached to a connector or to a pipeline, we may still
want to specify conditions for its execution. To do this, we can add a `condition`
key to the processor definition in the [Pipeline Configuration File](/docs/using/processors/getting-started#using-a-pipeline-configuration-file), or using
the [HTTP API](/docs/using/processors/getting-started#using-the-http-api) including this parameter in the [POST request](/api#post-/v1/processors).

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  ![Processor condition](/img/processor-condition.svg)
</div>

The `condition` key follows the [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) format, allowing the use of
any function provided by [sprig](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/).

If the expression evaluates to **true**, the processor will be executed; otherwise,
the record will continue to flow in the pipeline without being processed by this
processor.

:::note

Conduit will parse the output of the go template using
[`strconv.ParseBool`](https://pkg.go.dev/strconv#ParseBool) which means that `1`,
`t`, `T`, `TRUE`, `true` and `True` will all evaluate to `true`, while `0`, `f`,
`F`, `FALSE`, `false`, `False` will be evaluated to `false`. If an expression can't
be evaluated as a boolean, the processor will return an error.

## Example of a condition

Here's an example of a simple condition. In this case, records **will** be processed
by the [`json.decode` builtin processsor](/docs/using/processors/builtin/json.decode) when
he [OpenCDC Metadata](/docs/core-concepts/opencdc-record#fields) contains a key named
`key` which value is equal to `expected-value`.

```yaml
version: 2.2
pipelines:
  - id: example-pipeline
    connectors:
    # define source and destination connectors
    # ...
    processors:
      - id: extract-name
        plugin: json.decode
        settings:
          field: .Payload.After.name
        condition: `{{ eq .Metadata.key "expected-value" }}`
```
