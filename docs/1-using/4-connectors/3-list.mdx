The Conduit team and our community of developers are always adding new connectors.
Don't see the connector you need below? Help us prioritize by creating new issues,
commenting, or leaving a `+1` on our [source](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aconnector%3Asource+is%3Aopen)
and [destination](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aconnector%3Adestination+is%3Aopen)
connector lists.

Don't have time to wait? You can get started [building your own](/docs/developing/connectors/) in no time.

### Built-in vs Standalone

A Conduit connector can run in one of two ways: _built-in_ or _standalone_.
Built-in refers to connectors that are compiled into the Conduit binary, while
standalone refers to connectors that run separately from Conduit. You can learn
more about standalone vs built-in connectors on our
[Connector Behavior](/docs/connectors/behavior) page. A small set of connectors
are built into Conduit by default. For those connectors no additional setup is
required and you can start using them in Conduit right away.

### Connector Types

Source means the connector has the ability to get data from an upstream data
store. Destination means the connector can write to a downstream data store.

import ConnectorList from '@site/src/components/ConnectorList';
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

export const Connectors = ({url}) => {
  const [connectors, setConnectors] = useState([])
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url)
      .then(response => response.json() )
      .then(data => {
        setConnectors(data);
        setLoading(false);
      })
      .catch(err => {
        setError(err);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, []);

  if (loading) {
    return <p>Loading list...</p>;
  }
  if (error) {
    return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
  }
  return <ConnectorList connectors={connectors} />
}

<Connectors url={useBaseUrl('/connectors.json')} />
