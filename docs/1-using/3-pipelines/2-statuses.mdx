Understanding the different statuses of your pipeline is crucial for effective monitoring and management. Below are the various statuses that a pipeline can have in Conduit.

## Statuses Overview

| Status                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Running**            | The pipeline is actively processing data and functioning as expected.      |
| **Stopped**            | The pipeline has been stopped by the system or manually by a user shutting down gracefully. |
| **Degraded**           | The pipeline has been stopped due to an error or force-stopped by a user. |
| **Recovering**         | The pipeline is in the process of recovering from a degraded state or error. |

## Status Descriptions

### Running
-  **Definition**: The pipeline is currently active and processing data without any issues.
-  **Implication**: All systems are functioning normally, and data is flowing as expected.

### Stopped
-  **Definition**: The pipeline has been halted by the system, or manually stopped by a user.
-  **Implication**: The pipeline gracefully stopped, any in-flight records were flushed, acks were delivered back to the source, no error was encountered while stopping the pipeline. The pipeline could be restarted.

### Degraded
-  **Definition**: The pipeline stopped due to an error that couldn't be recovered, or force-stopped by the user.
-  **Implication**: An error caused the pipeline to stop. Any in-flight records were dropped, not all acks might have been delivered back to the source. Starting a degraded pipeline again could potentially result in duplicated data (depending on how the destination connector handles records), since some data might get re-delivered.

### Recovering
-  **Definition**: The pipeline is in the process of recovering from a degraded state or error.
-  **Implication**: The system is attempting to restore normal operations. Monitor the status to ensure recovery is successful.
