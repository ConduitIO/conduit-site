Weâ€™re excited to announce the release of [**Conduit v0.12.0**](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/tag/v0.12.0), which introduces **Pipeline Recovery**! This new feature enhances the resilience of your data streaming pipelines, ensuring they can recover from temporary errors without manual intervention.

#### Key Highlights

-  **Automatic Pipeline Restart:** Pipelines that encounter errors will now automatically restart, using a smart backoff algorithm to manage retries.
-  **Configurable Backoff Settings:** Customize the backoff parameters through CLI flags, environment variables, or a global configuration file.
-  **Smart Retry Management:** Limits on retries prevent indefinite restarts, keeping your pipelines efficient and reliable.
