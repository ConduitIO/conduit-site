v0.12.2 comes with up to 5x more throughput, new CLI command for initializing
Conduit and pipelines, as well as bug fixes.

<!--truncate-->

### Key Highlights

- **Up to 5x higher throughput**: We started revamping the internal engine
  that's running pipelines which resulted in a 5x higher throughput. If you're
  interested in how we did it, you can find more information
  in [this pull request](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/pull/1913). We'll
  also publish a blog post where we will go into the details. The feature is
  still experimental, and can be enabled with the `-preview.pipeline-arch-v2`
  flag.
- **New CLI commands**: We added two new CLI commands, `init` and
  `pipelines init`. `init` lets you initialize Conduit (with a pre-filled
  configuration file and the needed directories). `pipelines init` can
  initialize a pipeline with connectors of your choice and pre-populated
  configuration parameters. You can run `conduit --help` to learn more about the
  new commands.
- **Bug fixes**

You can install v0.12.2 with `curl https://conduit.io/install.sh | bash` or you
