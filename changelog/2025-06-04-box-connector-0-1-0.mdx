Conduit's ecosystem got richer with the release of a new connector: Box
connector [v0.1.0](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-box/releases/tag/v0.1.0). This release brings us a destination for Box.

<!--truncate-->

### Key Highlights

- We've developed a destination connector for [Box](https://www.box.com/).
- The destination connectors support writing chunked files. 
- The support for chunking comes from using standard OpenCDC metadata. That
  means that the Box destination connector can write large files read by other
  similar connectors (such as the [Dropbox source connector](/docs/using/connectors/list/dropbox)).
- You can download the
  connector [here](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-box/releases/tag/v0.1.1).
- To learn how to use and configure the connector, please visit
  its [documentation page](/docs/using/connectors/list/box).
