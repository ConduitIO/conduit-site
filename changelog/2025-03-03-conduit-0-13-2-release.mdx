Today, we released Conduit [v0.13.2](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/tag/v0.13.2) to fix the possibility of building custom Conduit applications after the introduction of our [Conduit CLI](/docs/cli).

Check out this page for more information on [how to build custom Conduit applications](/docs/using/connectors/additional-built-in-plugins).

### More information

With the [Conduit CLI](/docs/cli) addition on [v0.13.0](/changelog/2025-02-04-conduit-0-13-0-release), there was a package restructure that made it difficult to build a custom Conduit application like you normally would if you wanted to add your own connector plugin as [builtin](/docs/core-concepts#built-in-connector). This [v0.13.2](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/tag/v0.13.2) should fix that possibility.
