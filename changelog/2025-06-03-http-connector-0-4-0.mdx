[Conduit HTTP Connector v0.4.0](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-http/releases/tag/v0.4.0) is now
available, introducing new features and improvements for the HTTP connector.


<!--truncate-->

### Key Highlights

- [**Add validateConnection configuration parameter**](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-http/pull/83)
This release adds the new configuration option `validateConnection`, giving the user the freedom to choose whether to validate the
connection to the HTTP server before streaming data or not. This can be useful if the source or destination's HTTP server
don't support receiving `HEAD` requests (which is what the connector uses to validate the connection), or if the server
is not expecting such a request. So now the user can choose if the connection will be validated or not.
