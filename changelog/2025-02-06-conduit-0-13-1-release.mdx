After we released Conduit [v0.13.0](/changelog/2025-02-04-conduit-0-13-0-release), there were a couple of things that weren't working as we had planned.

Thanks to the quick reports from our users, we were able to fix them promptly and release a new version: Conduit [v0.13.1](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/tag/v0.13.1).

<!--truncate-->

### Key Highlights

- We fixed a bug that required an argument for the `conduit pipelines init` command. This was unintentional since we want people to be able to quickly initialize a pipeline even without thinking of what name to provide.  
-  We improved the experience when providing a wrong Conduit Configuration file via `--config.path`, part of the `conduit run` command.
