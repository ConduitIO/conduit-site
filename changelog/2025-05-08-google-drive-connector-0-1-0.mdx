We're introducing the new **Google Drive Connector for Conduit**, a destination-only connector that enables you to stream files directly into Google Drive from your Conduit pipelines. This is ideal for backing up data, sharing generated documents, or integrating file output into cloud workflows.

### Key Highlights

- **Destination-only connector**
- **Create + Stream operations supported**
- **Target specific folders**: Control where files are stored in Drive.
