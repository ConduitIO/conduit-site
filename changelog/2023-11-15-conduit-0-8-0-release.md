We're excited to announce a new release of [**Conduit v0.8**](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/tag/v0.8.0)! This update prioritizes performance enhancements, aiming to establish Conduit as the default tool for data movement.

### Key Highlights

- **Performance Boost**: Weâ€™ve achieved a performance increase of over 2.5x, reaching nearly 70k messages per second through a single Kafka-to-Kafka pipeline. This improvement results from optimizations in the core of Conduit and enhancements to our Kafka Connector.

### Future Work

While we've made significant strides in performance, we are exploring further improvements, particularly in **micro-batching**. This technique combines multiple records into a single batch for processing, allowing us to push nearly 250k messages per second through a single pipeline. This experimental work demonstrates the potential for even greater performance gains.

For those interested, the experimental micro-batching work is available in a branch of the Conduit repository.
