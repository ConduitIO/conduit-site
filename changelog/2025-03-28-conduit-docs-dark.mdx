As part of our 2025 Q1 Champagne week, we finally took a spin on our documentation site and added a dark theme to it.

It was a long-awaited feature, and we're happy to announce that it's finally possible to read our documentation at night without straining your eyes ðŸŽ‰.

The theme will automatically change based on your system preferences, but you can also manually switch between light and dark themes using the toggle in the top right corner of the site.
