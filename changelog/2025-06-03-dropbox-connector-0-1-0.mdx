We're stepping into June with a new connector, this time
for [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com). 

<!--truncate-->

### Key Highlights

- We've developed a source and a destination connector.
- The source and destination connectors support chunking of large files. 
- Chunking is done using standard OpenCDC metadata. That means that the Dropbox
  can send large files to other similar connectors (such as the upcoming Box
  connector). It works the opposite way too!
- You can download the
  connector [here](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-dropbox/releases/tag/v0.1.0).
- To learn how to use and configure the connector, please visit
  its [documentation page](/docs/using/connectors/list/dropbox).
