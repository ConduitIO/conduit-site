New year, new release! We're excited to announce that Conduit [v0.13.0](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/tag/v0.13.0) is off the press. This one includes some features we've been eager to ship for a while now.

### Key Highlights

{/* Include link of blog post here when it's available*/}
- A more automated method for keeping your connector documentation up to date. For more information, check out the [original discussion](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/discussions/1522).

{/* Include link of blog post here when it's available*/}
- Conduit doesn't include a User Interface anymore, but it comes with a [Command Line Interface](/docs/cli) that we think will fit better the needs of our users. Check out its dedicated page in our docs [here](/docs/cli) where we'll continue documenting its capabilities. [Here's where the original discussion took place](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/discussions/1642).

:::note
Conduit powers the [Meroxa Platform](https://meroxa.com), where we provide a fully featured UI as a separate product offering that should better suit your enterprise needs.
