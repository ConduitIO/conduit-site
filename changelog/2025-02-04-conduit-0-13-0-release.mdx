New year, new release! We're excited to announce that Conduit [v0.13.0](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/tag/v0.13.0) is off the press. This one includes some features we've been eager to ship for a while now.

<!--truncate-->

### Key Highlights

- A more automated method for keeping your connector documentation up to date. For more information, check out the [original discussion](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/discussions/1522), and the updated [Connector Specification documentation page](/docs/developing/connectors/connector-specification/).

- Conduit doesn't include a User Interface anymore, but it comes with a [Command Line Interface](/docs/cli) that we think will fit better the needs of our users. Check out its dedicated page in our docs [here](/docs/cli) where we'll continue documenting its capabilities. [Here's where the original discussion took place](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/discussions/1642). 


Extending the capabilities of our `conduit` binary, in order to run the service, you'll need to use the following command now:

```bash
$ conduit run
```

When running simply `conduit` in your terminal, you'll see all the available commands and options this new CLI provides:

```bash
$ conduit
Conduit CLI is a command-line that helps you interact with and manage Conduit.

Usage:
  conduit [flags]
  conduit [command]

Available Commands:
  config            Shows the configuration to be used when running Conduit.
  connector-plugins Manage Connector Plugins
  connectors        Manage Conduit Connectors
  help              Help about any command
  init              Initialize Conduit with a configuration file and directories.
  open              Open in a web browser
  pipelines         Initialize and manage pipelines

  run               Run Conduit
  version           Show the current version of Conduit.

Flags:
      --api.grpc.address string   address where Conduit is running
      --config.path string        path to the configuration file
  -h, --help                      help for conduit
  -v, --version                   show the current Conduit version
