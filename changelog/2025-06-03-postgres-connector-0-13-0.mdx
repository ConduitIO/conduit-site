Postgres connector [v0.13.0](/TBD) is out! It brings 14% more throughout in our
benchmarks, and it also improves support for `NUMERIC`/`DECIMAL` types.

<!--truncate-->

### Key Highlights

- We refactored how we move logical replication messages in the connector and
  achieved a 14% boost in performance (verified through our benchmarks). Here's
  the relevant
  PR: [#284](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-postgres/pull/284).
- We also improved support for the `NUMERIC`/`DECIMAL` type in Postgres. So far,
  we were reading it only if it can fit into an `int64` or `float64`. Now, the
  connector reads them as `big.Rat`
  values. [#290](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit-connector-postgres/pull/290).
