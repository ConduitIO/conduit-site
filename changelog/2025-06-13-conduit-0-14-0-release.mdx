We're happy to announce the release of Conduit [v0.14.0](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/tag/v0.14.0), introducing the [`split`](/docs/using/processors/builtin/split) and [`clone`](/docs/using/processors/builtin/clone) processors, which enables one source record to trigger a write of multiple records in the destination.

:::tip
The new processors return multiple records, which is currently only supported in the new v2 engine. If you want to try them out, you need to start Conduit using `conduit run --preview.pipeline-arch-v2`.

### Key Highlights

- New option `--connectors.max-receive-record-size` in `conduit run` to configure the record size when using standalone connectors. [More information](/docs/using/connectors/installing#record-size-limitations).
- Processor [`split`](/docs/using/processors/builtin/split) enables you to split an array in a record into separate records. This can be useful in AI pipelines where the input record contains a document and the output is multiple embeddings inserted into a database.
- Processor [`clone`](/docs/using/processors/builtin/clone) enables you to clone any record N times. This is useful when one input record needs to be split into multiple collections (tables) on the destination.
- Improvements for `pipelines init` command, which now creates a runnable demo pipeline when no flags are supplied.
