We'd like to let you know that
Conduit [v0.12.3](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/tag/v0.12.3) is
now out. It contains a fix for an issue related to batching as well as internal
improvements. 

<!--truncate-->

### Key Highlights

- **Fix for a batching bug**: The
  issue [#1987](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/pull/1987) made Conduit
  wait for the whole batching timeout when it encountered a filtered record.
- **Internal improvements**: More tests, dependency upgrades, and documentation
  updates are also in this release.

You can install v0.12.3 with `curl https://conduit.io/install.sh | bash` or you
can download a binary
from [here](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases/tag/v0.12.3).
