# How to add a Connector with Conduit REST API Swagger UI

By default, Conduit ships with a robust REST API that allows you to automate the creation of data pipelines and connectors. To make it easy to get started with the API, we have provided a [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/) to visualize and interact with the Condiut without having to write any code...yet ðŸ˜‰.

## Starting Conduit

To get started, you need to [install and start](/docs/introduction/getting-started) Conduit. You may [even add Conduit to your `$PATH`](/guides/adding-a-connector-with-rest-swagger-ui).

```bash
./conduit
```

## Open Swagger UI

To open the Swagger UI, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/openapi`.

This UI allows you to interact with the API and create connectors. It also serves as a reference for the API.
