# How to add Conduit to your Path

Adding Conduit to your [path](https://zwbetz.com/how-to-add-a-binary-to-your-path-on-macos-linux-windows/) makes it easy to start Conduit locally on your machine. From anywhere in your terminal, you’ll be able to run:

## Adding to Environment

These instructions are specific to UNIX-based machines. However, you may find instructions for other operating systems here: [How to Add a Binary (or Executable, or Program) to Your PATH on macOS, Linux, or Windows](https://zwbetz.com/how-to-add-a-binary-to-your-path-on-macos-linux-windows/).

To accomplish this, it’s best practice to place a `bin` folder in your home directory and add it to your path:

```jsx
mkdir ${HOME}/bin
```

If you’d prefer to add the binary to an existing path, you may see what's currently in your [$PATH](https://askubuntu.com/questions/551990/what-does-path-mean) with the following command:

```jsx
echo $PATH
```


Next, you’ll want to make sure your new folder is in your `$PATH`. You can do this by updating your shell profile. 

### Zsh

```jsx
vi ${HOME}/.zshrc
```

### Bash

```jsx
vi ${HOME}/.bashrc
```

In your shell profile, add the following line:

```jsx
export PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/bin"
```

Lastly, restart your terminal.

## Downloading the Conduit binary

You may download the binary for your machine architecture here: [Releases · ConduitIO/conduit](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit/releases).

After downloading, place your binary in the directory you created earlier: `${HOME}/bin` . Now, in your session, you should be able to run the `conduit` command.

Enjoy ☕.
