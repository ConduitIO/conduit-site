# How to test Conduit's REST API with Swagger UI

By default, Conduit ships with a REST API that allows you to automate the creation of data pipelines and connectors. To make it easy to get started with the API, we have provided a [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/) to visualize and interact with the Condiut without having to write any code...yet ðŸ˜‰.

After you start Conduit, if you navigate to `http://localhost:8080/openapi/`, you will see a page that looks like this:

<img
    className="rounded-md"
    src="/images/guides/adding-a-connector-with-rest-swagger-ui/conduit-rest-api-swagger-ui.png"
    alt="Conduit in Terminal"
/>

Then, after you test the API, you can write code to make the equilivent request. For example, here is how you would make a request using the [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) Node.js library.

```js
const config = {
    type: 'TYPE_SOURCE',
    plugin: `${pkgPath}/pkg/plugins/pg/pg`,
    pipelineId: pipeline.id,
    config: {
        name: 'pg',
        settings: {
            table: pgTable,
            url: pgUrl,
            cdc: 'false',
        },
    },
}

const response = await axios.post(`http://localhost:8080/v1/connectors`, config)
```

Esentially, the API is everything you'd need to auomate pipeline creation. Let's begin.

## Starting Conduit

To get started, you need to [install and start](/docs/introduction/getting-started) Conduit. You may [even add Conduit to your `$PATH`](/guides/adding-a-connector-with-rest-swagger-ui).

```bash
./conduit
```

To open the Swagger UI, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/openapi`. This UI allows you to interact with the API and create connectors. It also serves as a reference for the API.

## Making a Request

The API lets you manage all parts of Conduit. For example, all we need to create and start a pieline are these three APIs:

-   Create Pipelines - `POST /v1/pipelines`
-   Create Connectors - `POST /v1/connectors`
-   Start/Stop Pipelines `POST /v1/pipelines/{id}/start`

Let's use the Swagger UI to create a pipeline.

1. First, find the create pipeline API, and select "Try it out":

<img
    className="rounded-md"
    src="/images/guides/adding-a-connector-with-rest-swagger-ui/create-pipeline-api.png"
    alt="Conduit in Terminal"
/>

2. Update the `body` of the request with your new pipeline details:

<img
    className="rounded-md"
    src="/images/guides/adding-a-connector-with-rest-swagger-ui/try-it-now-create-pipeline.png"
    alt="Create a Conduit Pipeline"
/>

In this case, the config describes the `name` and the `description` of the new pipeline:

```json
{
    "config": {
        "name": "string",
        "description": "string"
    }
}
```

3. Select "Execute", notice the `response` of the request:

<img
    className="rounded-md"
    src="/images/guides/adding-a-connector-with-rest-swagger-ui/api-response.png"
    alt="Conduit API Response"
/>

For every request, you will be able to try it out, see the body of the request, and the expected response.
