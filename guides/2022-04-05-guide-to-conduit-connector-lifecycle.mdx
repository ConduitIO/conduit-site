# The Guide to the Conduit Connector Lifecyle

The goal of Conduit is to have the best experience when it comes to building connectors. The Conduit Connector Lifecyle describes TODO. 

Listed in the order they are called, here are the methods you can implement for Conduit Connectors:

- Configure
- Open
- Read
- Ack
- Write Async
- Write
- Flush
- Teardown

<!--truncate-->

## Configure

`Configure` is always the first function to be called in a connector. The goal of this method is to store and validate the connector configuration. 

```go
func (d *Destination) Configure(ctx context.Context, cfg map[string]string) error 
```

Its important to note that validating if your connector can reach the configured data source should be done in `Open`, not in `Configure`. In this function, you should validate the presence or format of required parameters.


## Open

`Open` is called after Configure to signal the plugin it can prepare to
start producing records. If needed, the plugin should open connections in
this function. 

```go
 func (d *Destination) Open(ctx context.Context) error 
```

## Read

`Read` returns a new [Record](/record) and is supposed to block until there is either
a new record or the context gets cancelled.

```go
 func (d *Destination) Write(ctx context.Context, record sdk.Record) error 
```

## Ack

`Ack` signals to the implementation that the record with the supplied
position was successfully processed.

```go
 func (d *Destination) Write(ctx context.Context, record sdk.Record) error 
```

## Write Async

`WriteAsync` receives a Record and can cache it internally and write it at
a later time. `WriteAsync` can be used for batch writing or buffering data to a destination.

```go
 func (d *Destination) Write(ctx context.Context, record sdk.Record) error 
```

## Write

`Write` receives a Record and is supposed to write the record to the
destination right away.

```
 func (d *Destination) Write(ctx context.Context, record sdk.Record) error 
```

**Note:** `WriteAsync` takes precedence and will be used first to write a record. If
`WriteAsync` is not implemented, the SDK will fallback to `Write`.


## Flush

`Flush` signals the plugin it should flush any cached records. This function needs to be implemented only
if the struct implements `WriteAsync`. 

```
 func (d *Destination) Teardown(ctx context.Context) error 
```

## Teardown

`Teardown` signals to the plugin that there will be no more calls to any
other function. 

```
 func (d *Destination) Teardown(ctx context.Context) error 
```

## What's Next

As mentioned above, by defining the Conduit Lifecyle, Conduit connectors gain some means of consistancy between different conectors. As a developer, this consistancy makes it easy to create connectors, debug connectors, and contributing to connectors. 

You can see examples of the methods above within the following connectors:

- [PostgreSQL Connector](https://github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-pg)
- [File Connector](https://github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-file)
- [Kafka Connector](https://github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-kafka)
- [Generator Connector (Source Only)](https://github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-generator)
- [Amazon S3 Connector](https://github.com/conduitio/conduit-connector-s3)

I can't wait to see what you build ðŸš€. If you have any questions or feedback:
