  name: log
  summary: A destination connector that logs all incoming records.
  description: |
    ## Destination

    The destination connector logs records using the built-in Conduit logger.

    Example log message:

    ```
    {"level":"info","record":{"position":"cjI=","operation":"create","metadata":{"foo":"bar","opencdc.version":"v1"},"key":{"my-id-field":1},"payload":{"before":nil,"after":{"my-payload-field":false}}}}
    ```

    Note that the `position` field is base64 encoded, same goes for a key or payload
    that contains raw byte data.

    Keep in mind that Conduit's log level needs to be configured lower or equal to
    the log level of the connector in order for the records to show up in the logs.
