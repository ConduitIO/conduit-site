  summary: A Conduit connector for Box.com.

    ## Destination

    The Box Destination takes a Conduit record and uploads it to the remote Box directory.

    ### Create, Update and Snapshot Operations

    The Box destination connector uploads the records in 3 different ways.

    * For a file which is <= 4MB, it uploads the single record file using a single
    `POST /files/content`.
    * For a file which is >= 4MB and <= 20MB, it assembles the file in memory. Once
    the file is fully assembled, it uploads it using a single
    `POST /files/content` request.
    * For a file which is > 20MB, it uploads the file using chunk upload endpoint.
    It first creates a new session for chunk upload which gives session id and
    part size in response. Using this session id and part size the records are
    then uploaded. It prepares the parts by keeping them in memory and upload the
    parts one by one using chunk upload endpoint.

    ### Delete Operation

    An OpenCDC record with the `delete` operation is processed so that the file
    that's found in the `opencdc.file.name` metadata field is deleted.

    ## Generating an Access Token

    The destination connector requires a token so it can authenticate with the
    Box.com HTTP API. To generate it, please follow the steps below.

    ### Step 1: Access the Box Developer Console

    1. Navigate to [https://app.box.com/developers/console](https://app.box.com/developers/console).
    2. Sign in using your Box.com credentials.

    ### Step 2: Create a New App

    1. In the Box Developer Console, click **Create Platform App**.
    2. Choose **Custom App** as the app type.
    3. Select **User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)** as the authentication method.
    4. Enter your app details:
       - **App Name**: Use a descriptive name (e.g., *Conduit Box Connector Prod*).
       - **Description**: Provide a brief explanation of your app's purpose.
       - **Purpose**: Describe the app's purpose. This field is informational only and does not affect connector functionality.
    5. Click **Create App**.

    ### Step 3: Configure App Settings

    1. On your app's configuration page, go to the **Configuration** tab.
    2. Under **Application Scopes**, enable:
       - **Read all files and folders stored in Box**

    ### Step 4: Obtain an Access Token

    1. In the **Developer Token** section, click **Generate Developer Token**.
    2. Copy the generated token for use.

    ### Token Management

    You can store the access token in one of the following ways:
    - As a plain string in a configuration file
    - As an environment variable
