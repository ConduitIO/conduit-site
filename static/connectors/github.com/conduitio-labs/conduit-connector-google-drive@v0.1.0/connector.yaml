  summary: Conduit Connector for Google Drive.
  description: |-
    The Google Drive connector is one of [Conduit](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit)'s plugins. It provides a **destination connector** for writing records into a specified Google Drive folder.

    ## Destination

    The Google Drive Destination Connector connects to a Google Drive account using a service account's credentials and uploads incoming records as files into a configured folder.

    Note: The destination connector only supports the `create` and `snapshot` operations. It does not support the `delete` or `update` operations.

    ### Authentication

    This connector uses a **Google service account** for authentication. Ensure that the service account has write access to the target Drive folder by either:

    - Sharing the folder directly with the service account email, or
    - Using domain-wide delegation (if operating within a Google Workspace organization)"
