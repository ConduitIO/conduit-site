  summary: A Conduit Connector for MySQL
  description: |
    ## Source

    A source connector pulls data from an external resource and pushes it to
    downstream resources via Conduit.

    ### Snapshot mode

    Snapshot mode is the first stage of the source sync process. It reads all rows
    from the configured tables as record snapshots.

    In snapshot mode, the record payload consists of
    [opencdc.StructuredData](https://conduit.io/docs/using/opencdc-record#structured-data),
    with each key being a column and each value being that column's value.

    ### Change Data Capture mode

    When the connector switches to CDC mode, it starts streaming changes from the
    obtained position at the start of the snapshot. It uses the row-based binlog format
    to capture detailed changes at the individual row level.

    ### Unsafe snapshot

    By default, the connector will error out if it finds a table that has no primary key and no specified sorting column specified, as we can't guarantee that the snapshot will be consistent. Table changes during the snapshot will be however captured by CDC mode.

    As of writing, the unsafe snapshot is implemented using batches with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`, so expect it to be slow for large tables. You can optimize the snapshot by specifying a sorting column (see source configuration parameters).
    The position of the table is currently not recorded, so the unsafe snapshot will restart from zero every time.

    ### Schema

    The source connector uses [avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.11.1/specification/) to decode mysql rows. Here's the MySQL datatype to avro datatype equivalence that the connector uses:

    | MySQL Type | Avro Type |
    | ---------- | --------- |
    | TINYINT    | int       |
    | SMALLINT   | int       |
    | MEDIUMINT  | int       |
    | INT        | int       |
    | BIGINT     | long      |
    | DECIMAL    | double    |
    | NUMERIC    | double    |
    | FLOAT      | double    |
    | DOUBLE     | double    |
    | BIT        | bytes     |
    | CHAR       | string    |
    | VARCHAR    | string    |
    | TINYTEXT   | string    |
    | TEXT       | string    |
    | MEDIUMTEXT | string    |
    | LONGTEXT   | string    |
    | BINARY     | bytes     |
    | VARBINARY  | bytes     |
    | TINYBLOB   | bytes     |
    | BLOB       | bytes     |
    | MEDIUMBLOB | bytes     |
    | LONGBLOB   | bytes     |
    | DATE       | string    |
    | TIME       | string    |
    | DATETIME   | string    |
    | TIMESTAMP  | string    |
    | YEAR       | long      |
    | ENUM       | string    |
    | SET        | string    |
    | JSON       | string    |

    ## Destination

    The MySQL destination takes a `opencdc.Record` and parses it into a valid SQL query. Each record is individually parsed and upserted. Writing in batches is [planned](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-mysql/issues/63) to be implemented, which should greatly improve performance over the current implementation.

    ### Upsert Behavior

    If the target table contains a column with a unique constraint (this includes PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE indexes), records will be upserted. Otherwise, they will be appended. Support for updating tables without unique constraints is tracked [here](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-mysql/issues/66).

    If the target table already contains a record with the same key, the Destination will upsert with its current received values. Because Keys must be unique, this can overwrite and thus potentially lose data, so keys should be assigned correctly from the Source.

    If there is no key, the record will be simply appended.

    ### Multicollection mode

    (Planned to do). You can upvote [the following issue](https://github.com/conduitio-labs/conduit-connector-mysql/issues/13) to add more interest on getting this feature implemented sooner.

    ## Requirements and compatibility

    The connector is tested against MySQL v8.0. Compatibility with older versions isn't guaranteed.

    ### MySQL Server Requirements:

    - Binary Log (binlog) must be enabled.
    - Binlog format must be set to ROW.
    - Binlog row image must be set to FULL.
    - Tables must have **sortable** primary keys.

    ### MySQL User Privileges:

    For Snapshot and CDC modes, the following privileges are required:

    - SELECT
    - LOCK TABLES
    - RELOAD
    - REPLICATION CLIENT
    - REPLICATION SLAVE

          Tables represents the tables to read from.
           - By default, no tables are included, but can be modified by adding a comma-separated string of regex patterns.
           - They are applied in the order that they are provided, so the final regex supersedes all previous ones.
           - To include all tables, use "*". You can then filter that list by adding a comma-separated string of regex patterns.
           - To set an "include" regex, add "+" or nothing in front of the regex.
           - To set an "exclude" regex, add "-" in front of the regex.
           - e.g. "-.*meta$, wp_postmeta" will exclude all tables ending with "meta" but include the table "wp_postmeta".
